Miguel Riofrio Sánchez ( September 7 , 1822 – October 11 , 1879 ) was an Ecuadoran poet , novelist , journalist , orator , and educator .
He was born in the city of Loja .
He is best known today as the author of Ecuador 's first novel La Emancipada ( 1863 ) .
Owing to the book 's length , usually less than 100 pages long , many experts have argued that it is really a novella rather than a full novel , and that Ecuador 's first novel is Juan León Mera 's Cumanda ( 1879 ) .
Nevertheless , thanks to the arguments of the well - known and respected Ecuadorian writer Alejandro Carrión ( 1915 – 1992 ) , Miguel Riofrío 's La Emancipada has been accepted as Ecuador 's first novel .
Riofrio died in exile in Peru .

Paris Belongs to Us ( , sometimes translated as Paris Is Ours ) is a 1961 French mystery film directed by Jacques Rivette .
Set in Paris in 1957 and often referencing Shakespeare 's play Pericles , the title is highly ironic because the characters are immigrants or alienated and do not feel that they belong at all .
The story centres on an essentially innocent young university student called Anne who through her older brother meets a group of friends haunted by mysterious tensions and fears that lead two of them to commit suicide .
Among them is her opposite , a femme fatale called Terry who has had affairs with all the men .
The source of the malaise affecting the group is never explained , leaving viewers to ponder how far it might be an amalgam of individual imbalances , general existentialist anxiety , or the more specific paranoia of the Cold War as the world faced the possibility of nuclear annihilation .
Gobstoppers or jawbreakers are a type of hard candy .
They are usually round , and normally range from about 1 – 3   cm across ; though gobstoppers can be up to 8   cm in diameter .
The term gobstopper derives from ' gob ' , which is slang in United Kingdom and Ireland for mouth .
The sweet was a favourite amongst British schoolboys between World War I and World War II .
In his children 's book Charlie and the Chocolate Factory , British author Roald Dahl described " Everlasting Gobstoppers " , a fictional type of gobstopper that could never get smaller or be finished .
Gobstoppers usually consist of a number of layers , each layer dissolving to reveal a differently coloured ( and sometimes differently flavoured ) layer , before dissolving completely .
Gobstoppers are too hard to bite without risking dental damage ( hence the name jawbreaker ) .
Gobstoppers have been sold in traditional sweet shops for at least a century , often sold by weight from jars .
As gobstoppers dissolve very slowly , they last a very long time in the mouth , which is a major factor in their enduring popularity with children .
Larger ones can take days or even weeks to fully dissolve .

Portrayed by Nicole de Boer , she is a counselor aboard the Bajoran space station Deep Space Nine .
The character is a member of the Trill species , and is formed of both a host and a symbiont – referred to as Dax .
Ezri was introduced to the series following the death of the previous Dax host , Jadzia ( Terry Farrell ) at the end of .
It had been the producers ' intention to introduce a new female character bearing the symbiont in order to ensure that Nana Visitor as Kira Nerys was not the only female member of the main cast .
There were difficulties in casting initially , and the character changed from one who was intended to be " spooky " to one that was struggling to deal with all her previous personalities as a result of unexpectedly taking on the Dax symbiont .

The Revolt of the Brotherhoods ( , ) was a revolt by artisan guilds ( Germanies ) against the government of King Charles V in the Kingdom of Valencia , part of the Crown of Aragon .
It took place from 1519 – 1523 , with most of the fighting occurring during 1521 .
The Valencian revolt inspired a related revolt in the island of Majorca , also part of Aragon , which lasted from 1521 – 1523 .
The revolt was an anti - monarchist , anti - feudal autonomist movement inspired by the Italian republics .
It also bore a strong anti - Islamic aspect , as rebels rioted against Valencia 's peasant Muslim population ( also called mudéjars , to contrast with crypto - Muslims or Moriscos in the Crown of Castile , where Islam was outlawed ) and imposed forced conversions to Christianity .
The agermanats are comparable to the comuneros of neighboring Castile , who fought a similar revolt against Charles from 1520 – 1522 .
Both rebellions were partially inspired by the departure for Germany of Charles , the new King of both Castile and Aragon ( in a personal union that would form the basis for the Kingdom of Spain ) , to take the throne as Holy Roman Emperor and leaving behind a somewhat disreputable Royal Council and regent .

The Great Zab or Upper Zab ( ( al - Zāb al - Kabīr ) , , , ( zāba ʻalya ) ) is an approximately long river flowing through Turkey and Iraq .
It rises in Turkey near Lake Van and joins the Tigris in Iraq south of Mosul .
The drainage basin of the Great Zab covers approximately , and during its course , the rivers collects the water from many tributaries .
The river and its tributaries are primarily fed by rainfall and snowmelt – as a result of which discharge fluctuates highly throughout the year .
At least six dams have been planned on the Great Zab and its tributaries , but construction of only one , the Bekhme Dam , has commenced but was halted after the Gulf War .
The Zagros Mountains have been occupied since at least the Lower Palaeolithic , and Neanderthal occupation of the Great Zab basin has been testified at the archaeological site of Shanidar Cave .
Historical records for the region are available from the end of the third millennium BCE onward .
In the Neo - Assyrian period , the Great Zab provided water for irrigation for the lands around the capital city of Nimrud .
The Battle of the Zab – which ended the Umayyad Caliphate – took place near a tributary of the Great Zab , and the valleys of the river provided shelter for refugees from the Mongol conquest of Iraq .

The Sioux Quartzite is a Proterozoic quartzite that is found in the region around the intersection of Minnesota , South Dakota , and Iowa , and correlates with other rock units throughout the upper midwestern and southwestern United States .
It was formed by braided river deposits , and its correlative units are thought to possibly define a large sedimentary wedge that once covered the passive margin on the then - southern side of the North American craton .
In human history , it provided the catlinite , or pipestone , that was used by the Plains Indians to carve ceremonial pipes .
With the arrival of Europeans , it was heavily quarried for building stone , and was used in many prominent structures in Sioux Falls , South Dakota and shipped to construction sites around the Midwest .
Sioux Quartzite has been and continues to be quarried in Jasper , Minnesota at the Jasper Stone Company and Quarry , which itself was posted to the National Register of Historic Places on January 5 , 1978 .

" John Brown 's Body " ( originally known as " John Brown 's Song " ) is a United States marching song about the abolitionist John Brown .
The song was popular in the Union during the American Civil War .
The tune arose out of the folk hymn tradition of the American camp meeting movement of the late 18th and early 19th century .
According to an 1890 account , the original John Brown lyrics were a collective effort by a group of Union soldiers who were referring both to the famous John Brown and also , humorously , to a Sergeant John Brown of their own battalion .
Various other authors have published additional verses or claimed credit for originating the John Brown lyrics and tune .
The " flavor of coarseness , possibly of irreverence " led many of the era to feel uncomfortable with the earliest " John Brown " lyrics .
This in turn led to the creation of many variant versions of the text that aspired to a higher literary quality .
The most famous of these is Julia Ward Howe 's " The Battle Hymn of the Republic , " which was written when a friend suggested , " Why do you not write some good words for that stirring tune ? "
Numerous informal versions and adaptations of the lyrics and music have been created from the mid-1800s down to the present , making " John Brown 's Body " an example of a living folk music tradition .
Gyeongbokgung ( ) , also known as Gyeongbokgung Palace or Gyeongbok Palace , was the main royal palace of the Joseon dynasty .
Built in 1395 , it is located in northern Seoul , South Korea .
The largest of the Five Grand Palaces built by the Joseon dynasty , Gyeongbokgung served as the home of Kings of the Joseon dynasty , the Kings ' households , as well as the government of Joseon .
Gyeongbokgung continued to serve as the main palace of the Joseon dynasty until the premises were destroyed by fire during the Imjin War ( 1592 – 1598 ) and abandoned for two centuries .
However , in the 19th century , all of the palace 's 7,700 rooms were later restored under the leadership of Prince Regent Heungseon during the reign of King Gojong .
Some 500 buildings were restored on a site of over 40 hectares .
The architectural principles of ancient Korea were incorporated into the tradition and appearance of the Joseon royal court .
In the early 20th century , much of the palace was systematically destroyed by Imperial Japan .
Since then , the walled palace complex is gradually being restored to its original form .
Today , the palace is arguably regarded as being the most beautiful and grandest of all five palaces .
It also houses the National Palace Museum of Korea and the National Folk Museum within the premises of the complex .
" Hurdy Gurdy Man " is a song by the Scottish singer - songwriter Donovan .
It was recorded in April 1968 and released the following month as a single .
The song gave its name to the album The Hurdy Gurdy Man , which was released in October of that year in the United States .
The single reached number 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the US and number 4 on the UK Singles Chart .
Donovan wrote " Hurdy Gurdy Man " while in Rishikesh in India , where he was studying Transcendental Meditation with the Beatles .
The recording features a harder rock sound than Donovan 's usual material , supplying a range of distorted guitars and aggressive drums .
It also features an Indian influence with the use of a tambura , a gift to Donovan from George Harrison , who also helped write the lyrics .
The song may have been influenced by " Green Circles " , a psychedelic 1967 UK single by Small Faces .
The similarity is in the melody of the descending verse , the strange vocal delivery , and the topic of being visited by an enlightened stranger .
In 2012 , Donovan revealed that he 'd become friends with Small Faces in 1965 .
According to some sources , the song was written for the band Hurdy Gurdy ( which included Donovan 's old friend and guitar mentor Mac MacLeod ) with Donovan intending to be the producer , but the collaboration was cancelled due to creative disagreements , leading Donovan to record the song himself .
In the chapter dedicated to the song in Donovan 's autobiography , he says that he originally wanted it to be recorded by Jimi Hendrix .
Armenia (; , ; ; Armeniya ) , officially the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic ( Armenian SSR ; ; ) , also commonly referred to as Soviet Armenia , was one of the constituent republics of the Soviet Union in December 1922 located in the South Caucasus region of Eurasia .
It was established in December 1920 , when the Soviets took over control of the short - lived First Republic of Armenia and lasted until 1991 .
It is sometimes called the Second Republic of Armenia , following the First Republic of Armenia 's demise .
As part of the Soviet Union , the Armenian SSR transformed from a largely agricultural hinterland to an important industrial production center , while its population almost quadrupled from around 880,000 in 1926 to 3.3 million in 1989 due to natural growth and large - scale influx of Armenian Genocide survivors and their descendants .
On August 23 , 1990 , it was renamed the Republic of Armenia after its sovereignty was declared , but remained in the Soviet Union until its official proclamation of independence on 21 September 1991 .
Its independence was recognized on 26 December 1991 when the Soviet Union ceased to exist .
After the dissolution of the Soviet Union , the state of the post - Soviet Republic of Armenia existed until the adoption of the new constitution in 1995 .

Nezahualpilli ( Nahuatl for " fasting prince " ; 1464 – 1515 , ) was ruler ( tlatoani ) of the Mesoamerican city - state of Texcoco , elected by the city 's nobility after the death of his father , Nezahualcoyotl , in 1472 .
Like his father , he was a poet , was considered a sage , and had the reputation of being a fair ruler .
Only one of his poems survives : " Icuic Nezahualpilli yc tlamato huexotzinco " ( " Song of Nezahualpilli during the war with Huexotzinco " ) .
His court was a haven for astronomers , engineers , and soothsayers .
During his reign , he abolished capital punishment for a number of crimes and struggled to keep the political independence of Texcoco during the increasing centralization of Aztec power in Tenochtitlán .
When he told Moctezuma II that the Texcocan wise men had foretold foreign dominion over the Valley of Mexico , the emperor challenged him to a ball game .
Moctezuma considered the loss of the game a negative omen .
He married a daughter of Ahuitzotl only to later have her executed .
Her public improprieties and high social status qualified her for a punishment that would not have been applicable to someone of a lower status .
He was said to have taken numerous consorts and fathered 144 children .
Nezahualpilli was succeeded by his son Cacama .

Between these two classes , 35 ships were created .
During this time , the Navy also purchased two training vessels , USS Wolverine and USS Sable .
The Cold War led to multiple developments in the United States ' carrier fleet , starting with the addition of the and the .
One more class in the start of the Cold War , the United States - class , was canceled due to the Truman administration 's policy of shrinking the United States Navy and in particular , the Navy 's air assets .
The policy was eventually revised after a public outcry and Congressional hearings sparked by the Revolt of the Admirals .
Later in the Cold War era , the first of the classes dubbed " supercarriers " was born , starting with , followed by the and single ships , the first nuclear powered carrier and , the last conventionally powered carrier .

Giovanni Antonio Galli , also called lo Spadarino ( baptized January 16 , 1585 – after June 1651 ) was an Italian Baroque artist who was a member of the Caravaggisti ( followers of Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio ) .
He was born in Rome to a family originally from Florence .
His activities are poorly documented but he is known to have been working in Rome in 1597 .
In 1616 he worked on the decoration of the Sala Regia in the Palazzo del Quirinale with Carlo Saraceni .
He was long confused with his lesser - known brother Giacomo Galli , a gilder , picture framer and artist .
In 1943 the art historian Roberto Longhi identified Giovanni Antonio Galli as the painter of a number of works , based on stylistic comparison with The Miracle of Saint Valerie and Saint Martial , the artist 's only surviving documented work before the discovery of his frescoes in the Palazzo Madama .
Gianni Papi says that Galli 's " most typical and strikingly modern feature is that of human fragility and vulnerability " , and that this sets his work apart from that of other Caravaggists .
Of the Narcissus ( Rome , Palazzo Barberini ) , which has been attributed variously to Caravaggio , Orazio Gentileschi , Bartolomeo Manfredi , and Galli , Elisabetta Giffi Ponzi says " the quality of lighting , the silky effects of the sleeves and elegiac tone of the work are typical of Spadarino ’s style . "
Ponzi says that Galli 's later works , such as the Palazzo Madama frescoes , show a stylistic decline resulting from his ambivalence toward new trends in Roman art .

Not to be confused with The Journal of American Science ( JAmSci , http://www.jofamericanscience.org/ ) .
The American Journal of Science ( AJS ) is the United States of America 's longest - running scientific journal , having been published continuously since its conception in 1818 by Professor Benjamin Silliman , who edited and financed it himself .
Until 1880 , it was also known as the American Journal of Science and Arts , but its focus was always on natural sciences and especially on geology and related subjects .
In early years , the journal was often referred to as " Silliman 's Journal " , and the publication became associated with Yale University due to his long tenure there ( 1804 – 1853 ) .
The editorship long remained in the family of Professor Silliman , as he was assisted by his son , Benjamin Silliman , Jr. , from 1838 .
On the death of the elder Silliman in 1864 , he was succeeded as chief editor by his son - in - law , James Dwight Dana , and then from 1895 till 1926 by Dana 's son Edward Salisbury Dana .
Associate editors included the botanist Asa Gray and the zoologist Louis Agassiz .
The current editors are C. Page Chamberlain , a professor at Stanford University , and Danny M. Rye and Mark T. Brandon , professors of geology at Yale University .

The Shackles of Memory Association ( Les Anneaux de la Mémoire in French - speaking countries ) is a non - profit association registered under the Law on Associations of 1901 , whose aim is to bring closer to the general public the history of the slave trade , slavery and their modern consequences , in order to promote new partnerships on a fair and respectful basis , between the societies of Africa , the Americas and Europe .
It is also dedicated to studying and bringing a new light on some elements in the history of various towns and regions from all around the world .
It first directed its attention to the city and region of Nantes ( France ) and its historical link to slavery .
The association is also active at international level by providing support to anyone interested in doing research on those dark chapters of human history .
Shared values of liberty , respect , equality and solidarity and a concern for scientific accuracy in its understanding of historical , social and economic factors are core principles that underpin the association 's work and projects .
In choosing its name “ Shackles of Memory ” , the association intended to :
recall the captives ' shackles in African caravans , on slave ships and on plantations in the New World ;
evoke the links in the historical chain which the populations concerned can relate to ;
highlight the alliances which the people of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans can initiate for a renewed triangle cooperation based on respectful and prosperous relationships .
The Golden Charter of Bern ( also : Golden Bull , in German : Goldene Handfeste or Berner Handfeste ) is a medieval charter purporting to have been issued by Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II .
It establishes the town privileges of Bern ( now the capital of Switzerland ) , making it an Imperial Free City and , effectively , an independent state .
The charter is dated to 1218 , but is now believed by most scholars to be a Bernese forgery from the middle of the 13th century .
The charter 's 54 articles provided for extensive privileges , including the free election of the Schultheiss ( i.e. , mayor ) and the right to autonomously legislate .
It also provided for the establishment of an Imperial Mint , which was established in 1228 at the latest , to coin Berner Pfennige .
These rights were formally confirmed by King Rudolf I in 1274 , and the issue of the charter 's authenticity thus made moot .
The charter is called " golden " due to its impressive ( and undoubtedly authentic ) golden bull , or seal .
Its face shows Frederick on the throne with his Emperor 's regalia , circumscribed " Frederick , by the Grace of God Roman King , ever increasing the Empire , King of Sicily . "
The issue of whether the charter — regarded as Bern 's founding document for centuries — is authentic has been contentious among historians since the 1860s .
Modern researchers now seem to agree that it is a forgery done on behalf of Bern 's government during the middle of the 13th century , done to establish in writing the rights the city had in practice seized decades previously .
They point out that the exceptional liberties granted by the charter were very atypical for the time , and that the writing seems to match that of one writer in the Frienisberg monastery .
Monasteries , at that time , were masters of the pia fraus , the " pious fraud " of falsifying documents to match a dead benefactor 's supposed intent .
On the other hand , X - ray analysis in 2002 did not reveal any indication that ( as had been assumed ) the authentic bull had been removed from an authentic document and then re - affixed to the Bernese charter .

Culture : Wichqana was active from around 1200 - 800 BC during the Kishka Pata Period and was a ceremonial center on the central highlands of Peru , on the Ayacucho Valley .
The ceremonial center was similar to Cerro Secchin and the centers were built in a U - shape of alternating sized stones .
The ceremonial center also included some Chavinoid features which shows that the Wichqana people were practicing some form of the Chavionoid culture .
The Wichqana have some of the Chavinoid culture because during this time period the styles and derivatives of the Chavin were thriving . On the site there were semicircle temple structures on artificial mounds which indicates some sort of priestly figure was used .
Also found on the Wichqana site , 5 skulls of women were found buried which indicates the importance of sacrifices .
When these decapitated heads were found , there were cobblestone of semi - ciricles found above them .
The pottery that was found on the site was typical and basic .
The pottery had little to no decoration but were typically brown , thin , with a pebble polish .
Economy : The main source of trade and production for the Wichqana people included agriculture ( potatoes , ocas , ullucus , maca , etc . )
and pastoralism and the two main animals that were used for herding were llamas and alpacas .
Along with agriculture and herding , hunting was also a large part of the economy which included common animals such as deer , rodents , and birds .
It had been confirmed that most of the trading was done along the northern part of the territory during the earlier period , then later moving more toward the coastal area during the later years .

Together they are basal in the subgenus Exornator , and might be intermediate between the core group of this subgenus and the species of the Rhombochaetodon ( or Roaops ) lineage .
If that is correct , the latter would require to be merged into Exornator .
If the genus Chaetodon is split up , Exornator might become a subgenus of Lepidochaetodon .

" New Rochelle Historic Site " is a designation of the Historical and Landmarks Review Board ( HLRB ) , for buildings , structures , monuments and other historically significant properties in the city of New Rochelle in Westchester County , New York .
Significant sites are chosen after meeting a combination of criteria , including historical , economic , architectural , artistic , cultural , and social values .
Settled by French refugees in the 1680s , New Rochelle grew from a farming community to a resort town to one of America ’s premier suburban communities , before becoming incorporated as a city in 1899 .
The 20th century brought tremendous growth and a lion ’s share of prominent individuals to the “ Queen City on the Sound ” .
Now the seventh largest city in the state , New Rochelle has an abundance of buildings and landscapes that relate an extraordinary 300 + year history .
In 1998 a consultant for the Historical and Landmarks Review Board was commissioned to prepare a Reconnaissance Level Cultural Resources Survey , an analysis of the most significant historic sites and structures in New Rochelle .
The project inventoried one historic district and 78 individual properties that fall within a broad spectrum of land use categories .
The principal goal of the survey was to identify the City ’s most treasured historic and architectural resources which are documented on New York State inventory forms .
Each individual resource was evaluated with respect to its eligibility for listing in the National Register of Historic Places .
The report follows the format established by SHPO , including the methodology for the survey , criteria for the selection of resources to be inventoried , a historical overview of the project area , a summary of cultural themes identified in the survey , an examination of the stylistic development of historic architecture in New Rochelle , and a narrative description of the existing conditions of the project area .

" Play It All Night Long " is a commentary on those who listen to Lynyrd Skynyrd 's " Sweet Home Alabama " , whom Zevon supposes only listen to the song because country life is so intolerable .
It is probably the only popular song ever written which contains a reference to brucellosis .
The term " dancing school " has been used as a euphemism for a brothel since the mid-17th century .

Beatallica is a mash - up band that plays music made from combinations of songs of the Beatles and Metallica .
A Beatallica song is typically a blend of a Beatles song and a Metallica song with a related title ( e.g.
" The Thing That Should Not Let It Be " , combining The Beatles ' " Let It Be " and Metallica 's " The Thing That Should Not Be " or " And Justice for All My Loving " combining Metallica 's " And Justice for All " and the Beatles ' " All My Loving " ) , though sometimes just a Beatles song will be used as a basis with modified lyrics .
The lyrics slip back and forth between the two songs , or occasionally neither , in lieu of original lyrics comically referencing Metallica , heavy metal music , or the heavy metal community .
While the scansion and melody are usually Beatles - based , the music is played metal style with some Metallica riffs and solos thrown in .
Consistent quirks made in the lyrics also criticize glam metal much in the fashion that thrash metal fans would do , as well as many references to blood .
Their version of " I Want to Hold Your Hand " called " I Want to Choke Your Band " , is an example of their criticism towards glam metal .
Although facing some misunderstandings in the media , members of Metallica itself have repeatedly praised the comedic styling of the group .
For example , Kirk Hammett has publicly remarked point - blank , " I think it 's cool , " and , " It 's just fun for me . "
James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich have also been friendly with the band .

R ( Factortame Ltd ) v Secretary of State for Transport was a judicial review case taken against the United Kingdom government by a company of Spanish fishermen who claimed that the United Kingdom had breached European Union law by requiring ships to have a majority of British owners if they were to be registered in the UK .
The case produced a number of significant judgments on British constitutional law , and was the first time that courts held that they had power to restrain the application of an Act of Parliament pending trial and ultimately to disapply that Act when it was found to be contrary to EU law .
The litigation was lengthy , and is typically divided into five main stages :
Factortame I , where the High Court and then the House of Lords both made a reference to the European Court of Justice on the legality of the Merchant Shipping Act 1988 's ( " MSA " ) requirement for UK fishing vessels to be 75 % UK owned .
After the ECJ confirmed the incompatibility of the Act with EU law , Factortame saw the House of Lords confirm the supremacy of EU law over national law in the areas where the EU has competence because of the UK acceding to the EU treaties .
Factortame II , where the ECJ held that the provisions of the MSA were required to be disapplied by the UK courts if they contravened EU law .
Factortame III , where the ECJ held that a member state could be liable for damages in an action by the European Commission for breach of EU law .
Factortame IV , where the House of Lords ruled that damages could be awarded against a member state like the UK for losses suffered by private parties under the Francovich v Italy principle , that wrongs by violation of a public body generate a private law claim from anybody who has suffered a directly connected loss ( also known as the doctrine of state liability ) .

It saw the band continuing to integrate elements of psychedelia and jazz into their music , a process they had begun on their previous album , Fifth Dimension .
In addition , the album captured the band and record producer Gary Usher experimenting with new musical textures , including brass instruments , reverse tape effects and an electronic oscillator .
The album also marked the emergence of the band 's bass player Chris Hillman as a talented songwriter and vocalist .
Prior to Younger Than Yesterday , Hillman had only received one shared writing credit with the Byrds , but this album saw him credited as the sole composer of four songs and a co - writer of " So You Want to Be a Rock ' n ' Roll Star " .
Byrds expert Tim Connors has commented that two of Hillman 's compositions on Younger Than Yesterday exhibited country and western influences and thus can be seen as early indicators of the country rock experimentation that would feature — to a greater or lesser degree — on all of the Byrds ' subsequent albums .
Upon release , the album peaked at number 24 on the Billboard Top LPs chart and reached number 37 on the UK Albums Chart .
It was preceded by the " So You Want to Be a Rock ' n ' Roll Star " single in January 1967 , which reached the Top 30 of the Billboard Hot 100 .
Two additional singles taken from the album , " My Back Pages " and " Have You Seen Her Face " , were also moderately successful on the Billboard singles chart .
However , none of the singles taken from the album charted in the United Kingdom .
Music critics Richie Unterberger and David Fricke have both remarked that although it was largely overlooked by the public at the time of its release , the album 's critical standing has improved over the years and today Younger Than Yesterday is considered one of the Byrds ' best albums .
The title of Younger Than Yesterday is derived from the lyrics of " My Back Pages " , a song written by Bob Dylan , which was covered on the album .

He formed a close professional relationship with the clock and automata maker Christopher Pinchbeck and from the mid-1720s began to demonstrate Pinchbeck 's designs in shows both in their own right and for magical effects in his conjuring act .

Wehrkraftzersetzung is a term from German military law during the Third Reich .
In 1938 , with Adolf Hitler moving Germany closer to war , the Nazi government issued a decree for the purpose of suppressing any activity opposed to the Nazi regime or the Wehrmacht .
The anti - sedition decree included the crime of Zersetzung der Wehrkraft .
Commonly called Wehrkraftzersetzung , the term is variously translated as " subversion of the war effort " , " undermining military morale " and " sedition and defeatism " .
Paragraphs already in the military penal code were consolidated and redefined , creating the new crime , which carried the death penalty .
In 1939 , a second decree was issued that extended the crime to civilians .
Discouraging statements , such as doubt about the ultimate victory of the Third Reich , or any criticism of its political or military leadership and its form of government , were punishable by death , or heavy sentences in military prisons , concentration camps , deployment to the field or to probationary units .
Conscientious objectors in particular were frequently convicted of Wehrkraftzersetzung in addition to other charges .
This was done to reduce the potential of negative influence on others , even when the refusal of military duty had not been publicized .
Many civilians were also convicted of Wehrkraftzersetzung by military courts .
On 25 August 1998 and 23 July 2002 , after lengthy debate , the German Bundestag removed the Nazi - era sentences from the German criminal justice system .
All Nazi military sentencing for conscientious objection , desertion , and all other forms of Wehrkraftzersetzung , were repealed as unjust .
Current German military law neither contains the term " undermining the military " nor its extensive rules .
However , a few offences that , in the Nazi era , were included under the umbrella of Wehrkraftzersetzung , remain on the statute books in a vague form .

CORDS ( Civil Operations and Rural Development Support ) was a pacification program of the governments of South Vietnam and the United States during the Vietnam War .
The program was created on 9 May 1967 , and included military and civilian components of both governments .
The objective of CORDS was to gain support for the government of South Vietnam from its rural population which was largely under the influence or controlled by the insurgent communist forces of the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese People 's Army of Vietnam ( PAVN ) .
Unlike earlier pacification programs in Vietnam , CORDS is seen by many authorities as a " successful integration of civilian and military efforts " to combat the insurgency .
By 1970 , 93 percent of the rural population of South Vietnam was believed by the United States to be living in " relatively secure " villages .
CORDS had been extended to all 44 provinces of South Vietnam , and the communist insurgency was much reduced .
Critics , however , have described the pacification programs and CORDS in terms such as " the illusion of progress " .
CORDS was , in the estimation of its first leader , Robert W. Komer , " too little , too late . "
With the withdrawal of U.S. military forces and many civilian personnel , CORDS was abolished in February 1973 .
CORDS temporary successes were eroded in the 1970s , as the war became primarily a struggle between the conventional military forces of South and North Vietnam rather than an insurgency .
North Vietnam prevailed in 1975 .

Jackson began his 33-year career during the Second World War , reading the 6:00 PM national evening news ( then the network 's main news program ) and anchoring coverage of many of the major news headlines of the day .

He was one of the first national radio newscasters to announce the assassination of John F. Kennedy on November 22 , 1963 .
According to former CBS News Correspondent Dan Rather in his book " The Camera Never Blinks " and in the 2003 book " President Kennedy Has Been Shot " , Rather had advised CBS news headquarters in New York from Dallas that there were unconfirmed reports that the President was dead .
Jackson was handed a slip of paper reading " JFK DEAD " and immediately went on air with the announcement , reporting Kennedy 's death as a fact ( which had not yet been confirmed , although it was true that Kennedy was already dead ) , and playing the U.S. national anthem , The Star - Spangled Banner .

The Kurgan hypothesis ( also known as the Kurgan theory or Kurgan model ) or steppe theory is the most widely accepted proposal to identify the Proto - Indo - European homeland from which the Indo - European languages spread out throughout Europe , Eurasia and parts of Asia .
It postulates that the people of a Kurgan culture in the Pontic steppe north of the Black Sea were the most likely speakers of the Proto - Indo - European language ( PIE ) .
The term is derived from the Russian kurgan ( ) , meaning tumulus or burial mound .
The Kurgan hypothesis was first formulated in the 1950s by Marija Gimbutas , who used the term to group various cultures , including the Yamna , or Pit Grave , culture and its predecessors .
David Anthony instead uses the core Yamna culture and its relationship with other cultures as a point of reference .
Marija Gimbutas defined the Kurgan culture as composed of four successive periods , with the earliest ( Kurgan I ) including the Samara and Seroglazovo cultures of the Dnieper – Volga region in the Copper Age ( early 4th millennium BC ) .
The people of these cultures were nomadic pastoralists , who , according to the model , by the early 3rd millennium BC had expanded throughout the Pontic – Caspian steppe and into Eastern Europe .
Three genetic studies in 2015 gave partial support to Gimbutas 's Kurgan theory regarding the Indo - European Urheimat .
According to those studies , haplogroups R1b and R1a , now the most common in Europe ( R1a is also common in South Asia ) would have expanded from the Russian and Ukrainian steppes , along with the Indo - European languages ; they also detected an autosomal component present in modern Europeans which was not present in Neolithic Europeans , which would have been introduced with paternal lineages R1b and R1a , as well as Indo - European languages .

" Rock ' n ' Roll Kids " was the winning song of the Eurovision Song Contest 1994 , composed by Brendan Graham and performed for Ireland by Paul Harrington and Charlie McGettigan .
The song was Ireland 's sixth overall victory , and represented an unprecedented third consecutive time that the same country had won the Contest .
There is a belief among many Eurovision fans that the song was deliberately chosen not to win , as it was performed by a male duo ( no male duos had ever won before ) and in a very static manner .
The pair were also much older than any other winners had been .
As the Contest rules require the previous year 's winner to host the next edition of the Contest , the argument runs that the Irish broadcaster was not prepared to do this for a third consecutive year , hence the selection .
The song , however , won the contest and is generally considered one of the Contest 's better entries - being performed in part by McGettigan and Jakob Sveistrup at the Congratulations special in late 2005 .
It was the first winning song ever to be performed without orchestral accompaniment , as McGettigan 's guitar and Harrington 's piano were the only instruments needed .
It was also the first time in the contest when a song scored over 200 points .
Lyrically , the song is a lament for the singers ' lost youths .
They remember growing up and listening to the popular music of the time ( Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis Presley ) and generally being trendy .
The song then moves forwards to the present , where both men are " too busy running to a different beat " to even stay in close contact with each other - while their children " do n't wanna be around us no more " .
The song was performed third on the night , following Finland 's CatCat with " Bye Bye Baby " and preceding Cyprus ' Evridiki with " Ime Anthropos Ki Ego " .
At the close of voting , it had received 226 points , placing 1st in a field of 25 .
The song was succeeded as winner in 1995 by Secret Garden representing Norway with " Nocturne " .
It was succeeded as Irish representative at the 1995 Contest by Eddie Friel with " Dreamin ' " .

Suomen Sisu ( Translated : Finnish Sisu ) is a Finnish association that defines itself as nationalist and patriotic , criticizing unlimited immigration and multiculturalism .
Suomen Sisu proclaims to support the idea of independent national states , that govern themselves sovereignly , and opposes supranational co - operation , especially the European Union .
Suomen Sisu was established as the Youth Organisation of the Association of Finnish Culture and Identity ( Suomalaisuuden Liitto ) in 1998 , but this affiliation was broken in 2000 .
The organization is not affiliated with any political party , but its members have operated in several parties as individuals .
The association gained publicity in the spring of 2006 when it published the Muhammad - cartoons on its web site .
Member of Parliament Jari Vilén asked the police to investigate the issue , but it did not lead to prosecution .
Finnish Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen apologised the deed in public , which was interpreted by Suomen Sisu as " flattering the islamists " .
Suomen Sisu was described as a " Nazi spirited " group by the Finnish newspaper Länsiväylä ; the association 's president deemed the description incorrect and filed a complaint with the Council for Mass Media in Finland .
The Council ruled that as the Länsiväylä had given the president of the association an opportunity to publish his own letter regarding the issue in the Länsiväylä , the Council saw no need for further action .
Suomen Sisu congratulated its members Jussi Halla - aho , Olli Immonen , James Hirvisaari and Juho Eerola for having been elected as the members of the parliament of Finland , 17 April 2011 in general elections . ,
Elizabethan literature refers to bodies of work produced during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I ( 1558 – 1603 ) , and is one of the most splendid ages of English literature .
Elizabeth I presided over a vigorous culture that saw notable accomplishments in the arts , voyages of discovery , the " Elizabethan Settlement " that created the Church of England , and the defeat of military threats from Spain .
During her reign a London - centred culture , both courtly and popular , produced great poetry and drama .
English playwrights combined the influence of the Medieval theatre with the Renaissance 's rediscovery of the Roman dramatists , Seneca , for tragedy , and Plautus and Terence , for comedy .
Italy was an important source for Renaissance ideas in England and the linguist and lexicographer John Florio ( 1553 – 1625 ) , whose father was Italian , a royal language tutor at the Court of James I , who had furthermore brought much of the Italian language and culture to England .
He also translated the works of Montaigne from French into English .
John M. Perry ( born 4 June 1952 ) is an English musician , songwriter , and author .
He came to prominence in the late 1970s as the guitarist for the English rock band the Only Ones .
The Only Ones came out of London during the first wave of punk ( 1976 – 77 ) and , rather like the New York bands the Heartbreakers and Television with whom they later toured , suffered from being too musical for lumpen - punk but too " new " for conservative record business sensibilities .
Though they were lumped in with the new wave vanguard , the band were too musically literate - not to mention long in the tooth - to be punks .
Rather they were sophisticated guitar rockers whose sound embraced all flavors of 50s and 60s rock .
Although never a huge commercial success , the band are highly influential .
Perry 's guitar style is noted for a combination of attack and melody , a mixture that the UK music magazine Sounds described as being " very superb " .

Atlanticism , also known as Transatlanticism , is the belief in or support for a close relationship between the United States , Canada and Europe regarding political , economic and defence issues , with the belief that it would maintain security and prosperity of the participating countries and protect perceived values that unite them .
The term derives from the Atlantic Ocean that separates the two continents .
The term can be used in a more limited way to imply support for North Atlantic military alliances , or in a more expansive way implying broader cooperation , perceived deeply shared values , a merging of diplomatic cultures , a sense of community and some degree of integration between North America and Europe .
In practice , the philosophy of Atlanticism encourages active North American , particularly US , engagement in Europe and close cooperation between the two sides of the ocean .
Atlanticism manifested itself most strongly during the Second World War and in its aftermath through the establishment of various euro - Atlantic institutions , most importantly NATO and the Marshall Plan .
Atlanticism varies in strength from region to region and country to country based on a variety of historical and cultural factors .
Atlanticism is often considered to be particularly strong in eastern and central Europe , and the United Kingdom ( linked to the Special Relationship ) .
Politically , it has tended to be associated most heavily and enthusiastically , but certainly not exclusively , with classical liberals , or the political right in Europe .
Atlanticism often implies an affinity for American political or social culture as well as the historical bonds between the two continents .
There is some tension between Atlanticism and continentalism on both sides of the Atlantic , with some people emphasising increased regional cooperation or integration over trans - Atlantic cooperation .
However , the relationship between Atlanticism and North American or European integration is complex and they are not seen in direct opposition to one another by many commentators .
Internationalism is the foreign policy belief combining both Atlanticism and continentalism .
The relative decrease of European power in the world , the fall of the Soviet Union , as well as the spread of Atlanticist norms outside of the North Atlantic region , have decreased the strength of Atlanticist thought since the end of the Cold War .
Other international relationships have been increasingly emphasised , although the trans - Atlantic relationship is still arguably the most important in the world .

Antiochus ( ) of Athens was a commander of ancient Greece during the Peloponnesian War who was left by the Athenian commander Alcibiades at Notium in command of the Athenian fleet in 407 BCE , with strict injunctions not to engage the Spartan commander Lysander .
Antiochus was the master of Alcibiades ' own ship , and his personal friend ; he was a skilful seaman , but arrogant and heedless of consequences .
His intimacy with Alcibiades had first arisen upon an occasion mentioned by the writer Plutarch , who tells us that Alcibiades in one of his first appearances in the popular assembly allowed a tame quail to escape from under his cloak , which occurrence suspended the business of the assembly , till it was caught by Antiochus and given to Alcibiades .
Antiochus gave no heed to the injunctions of Alcibiades , and provoked Lysander to an engagement in what came to be known as the Battle of Notium , in which fifteen Athenian ships were lost , and Antiochus himself was killed .
This defeat was a small but symbolic victory for the Spartans , and one of the main causes that led to the second banishment of Alcibiades .
It firmly established Lysander as a commander who was capable of defeating the Athenians at sea .

Paul Nash ( 11 May 1889 – 11 July 1946 ) was a British surrealist painter and war artist , as well as a photographer , writer and designer of applied art .
Nash was among the most important landscape artists of the first half of the twentieth century .
He played a key role in the development of Modernism in English art .
Born in London , Nash grew up in Buckinghamshire where he developed a love of the landscape .
He entered the Slade School of Art but was poor at figure drawing and concentrated on landscape painting .
Nash found much inspiration in landscapes with elements of ancient history , such as burial mounds , Iron Age hill forts such as Wittenham Clumps and the standing stones at Avebury in Wiltshire .
The artworks he produced during World War I are among the most iconic images of the conflict .
After the war Nash continued to focus on landscape painting , originally in a formalized , decorative style but , throughout the 1930s , in an increasingly abstract and surreal manner .
In his paintings he often placed everyday objects into a landscape to give them a new identity and symbolism .
During World War II , although sick with the asthmatic condition that would kill him , he produced two series of anthropomorphic depictions of aircraft , before producing a number of landscapes rich in symbolism with an intense mystical quality .
These have perhaps become among the best known works from the period .
Nash was also a fine book illustrator , and also designed stage scenery , fabrics and posters .
He was the older brother of the artist John Nash .

The Continental Army was the national army of first the Thirteen Colonies , and then the independent United States , during the American Revolutionary War , established by a resolution of the Congress on June 14 , 1775 , three days before the Battle of Bunker Hill , where it saw its first action under that title ..
The Continental Congress took a number of steps in the spring of 1775 to create the army in response to the Battles of Lexington and Concord in April and the seizure of Fort Ticonderoga in May.
The units composing the Continental Army changed frequently , especially in the first two years of the war .
From 1777 to the close of the war , the organization of the Continental Army became progressively more systematic and sophisticated .
The Continental Army that served at Yorktown in 1781 bore very little resemblance to the Continental Army that blockaded Boston in 1775 .
The Continental Congress was hostile to maintaining standing armies .
Under the Articles of Confederation the Congress did not have the power to raise national troops by means of a draft .
Enlistment in the Continental Army was voluntary ; and throughout the war there were Americans who elected to fight for King George III rather than for Congress .
Further , under the Articles of Confederation , the Continental Congress could not raise its own revenue directly .
Because of the resulting shortages in money and manpower , the Continental Army was often expected to work in conjunction with state - controlled militia units .
These units were called out as needed for short periods .
On several occasions the militia performed well , but Washington frequently noted the inefficiency of the militia in his correspondence .

The award was first made in 1993 , when it was given to Ted Dexter , the chairman of selectors for the England cricket team .
It was awarded again the following year , and , after a two - year break , annually from 1997 .
The Plain English Campaign was set up in 1979 when the founder , Chrissie Maher , shredded hundreds of jargon - filled forms and documents in Parliament Square , London .
The group made their first awards the next year , rewarding those organisations that used plain English , and highlighting those that did not .
Although the Foot in Mouth award was first made in 1993 , a specific acknowledgment was made to a comment by Dan Quayle , Vice President of the United States in 1991 .
The award has been presented 20 times , and only Rhodri Morgan and Boris Johnson have received it more than once .
The Welsh politician won in both 1998 and 2005 , and made a light - hearted response to his second win , claiming that the first award had " made [ his ] name . "
Politicians have been recipients of the award more times than any other group of people , collecting it on 14 occasions ; people from the world of sport have won four times .
The 43rd President of the United States , George W. Bush , received the award in 2008 , with the subtitle " Lifetime Achievement Award " , given not for a single quote , but for his continued " services to gobbledygook " .
Radicales K were a faction within the Radical Civic Union ( UCR ) , a political party in Argentina .
President Néstor Kirchner ( 2003 – 2007 ) was a Peronist but distrusted the Justicialist Party ( PJ ) as a support for his government .
He proposed instead a " transversalist " policy , seeking the support of progressive politicians regardless of their party .
He thus formed the Front for Victory and got support from factions of the PJ , the UCR and small centre - left parties .
Those Radicals who supported Kirchner were called Radicales K. They included , among others , Julio Cobos , Arturo Colombi , Miguel Saiz , Gerardo Zamora and Eduardo Brizuela del Moral .
The transversalist project was eventually dismissed , and Kirchner and his wife Cristina Fernández , who became President in 2007 , chose to fight for the control of the PJ instead .
Kirchner took control of the PJ , and some " Radicales K " slowly returned to the " Anti - K " faction of their party , most notably vice - president Julio Cobos and Governor of Catamarca province Eduardo Brizuela del Moral ; while other very prominent Radical politicians remained in the " K " wing of the Radical Civic Union , such as provincial governors Gerardo Zamora of Santiago del Estero , Ricardo Colombi of Corrientes and Miguel Saiz of Río Negro .

Limca is a lemon- and lime - flavoured carbonated soft drink made primarily in India and certain parts of the U.S.
It contains 60 calories per 150ml can .
The formula does not include fruit , relying instead on artificial flavours .
In an interview in 2008 , Ramesh Chauhan of Parle Bisleri revealed that he had approached the owners of Duke 's Lemonade , requesting them to share the formula for the drink with the promise not to make it in India , which was turned down .
Chauhan decided to come up with his own formula , which he launched under the Limca brand in 1977 .
In 1992 , when the Indian government allowed Coca - Cola to return for operations , at the same time as it admitted Pepsi for the first time , Coca - Cola bought local soft - drink ( soda ) brands , from Parle Bisleri owner Ramesh Chauhan including Limca , Thums Up ( a cola - like drink ) , Maaza ( a mango - juice based drink ) , Citra ( a clear lemon - lime drink ) , and Gold Spot ( Orange flavour ) .
Prior to 1988 , the original formula of Limca contained brominated vegetable oil ( BVO ) .
After worldwide reports of ill effects of BVO , its use in soft drinks was banned in India .
As a result of this ban , the formula for Limca was changed , and BVO was removed from the concentrate for Limca .
One of Limca 's taglines was " Limca .
It 's veri veri Lime & Lemoni . "

Otto Siffling ( 3 August 1912 – 20 October 1939 ) was a German footballer .
He was a player for the club SV Waldhof Mannheim .
He also played for the Germany national football team , making 31 appearances and scoring 17 goals between 1934 and 1938 .
He was a participant in the 1934 FIFA World Cup , where he scored a goal .
He was the centre forward of the Breslau Eleven that beat Denmark 8–0 in Breslau in 1937 and went on to win 10 out 11 games played during that year .
Otto Siffling was one of the most talented center forwards of the 1930s .
An opinionated and exceptionally gifted player , Siffling was a virtuoso on the pitch who impressed with his ingenuity and imagination when on the ball .
Being not keen on overly physical play , he was not a traditional center forward , preferring to create more than to score .
Taciturn in nature , he did not like to be in the spotlight and ovations at times made him feel uncomfortable .
His performance for the Breslau XI in 1937 was the pinnacle of his career .
In 1938 his level suddenly dropped inexplicably , so that he was not starting in the 1938 World Cup .
A year later he died of a pleurisy aged 27 .
In his 1978 book Fussball , Helmut Schön characterised Siffling as follows :
" As a center forward he was not a tank but a playing center forward who still was enormously dangerous in front of the goal ; in the famous game in Breslau he scored five goals .
He was creating goals and scoring goals . "

Coming to prominence in the 1950s as a progressive dixieland musician , Lacy went on to a long and prolific career .

A gaucho ( ) or gaúcho ( ) is a skilled horseman , reputed to be brave and unruly .
The gaucho is a national symbol in Argentina , Brazil and Uruguay .
Gauchos became greatly admired and renowned in legends , folklore and literature and became an important part of their regional cultural tradition .
Beginning late in the 19th century , after the heyday of the gauchos , they were celebrated by South American writers .
The gaucho in some respects resembled members of other nineteenth century rural , horse - based cultures such as the North American cowboy ( vaquero in Spanish ) , the Chilean huaso , the Peruvian chalan or morochuco , the Venezuelan or Colombian llanero , the Hawaiian paniolo , the Mexican charro or the Portuguese campino .
According to the Diccionario de la lengua española , in its historical sense a gaucho was " a mestizo who , in the 18th and 19th centuries , inhabited Argentina , Uruguay , and Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil , was a migratory horseman , and adept in cattle work " In Argentina and Uruguay today a gaucho is , according to the same source , simply " A country person , experienced in traditional livestock farming " .
Because historical gauchos were reputed to be brave , if unruly , the word is also applied metaphorically to mean " Noble , brave and generous " , but also " One who is skilful in subtle tricks , crafty " .
In Portuguese the word gaúcho ( note the accent ) means " An inhabitant of the plains of Rio Grande do Sul or the pampas of Argentina descended from European man and [ Amer]indian woman who devotes himself to lassoing and raising cattle and horses " ; and in Brazil gaúcho has also acquired a metonymic signification , meaning anyone , even an urban dweller , who is a citizen of the State of Rio Grande do Sul .
In its purest sense , gaucho referred to the nomadic , often outlaw inhabitants of the great plains of Argentina , Uruguay and Brazil .
In current usage , gaucho usually designates the rural working class in general . "

The President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , or the President of the Republic for short , was the head of state of that country from 14 January 1953 to 4 May 1980 .
Josip Broz Tito was the only person to occupy the office .
Broz was also concurrently President of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia .
Broz was eventually declared president for life and with his death in 1980 the office was discontinued and the new office of President of the Presidency of Yugoslavia took its place .
The 1946 constitution defined the government of Yugoslavia headed by a president ( commonly known as prime minister ) as the highest administrative authority in the country .
Broz served as Prime Minister during the entire period up to adoption of the 1953 constitution .
This law proclaimed the country to be a socialist republic and removed all previous references to a government , ministries , etc .
Instead it defined the office of President and the Federal Executive Council ( FEC ) in place of the government .
The President was to serve as both head of state and would also preside over the FEC , a body of 30 - 40 members some of whom would be selected to be federal secretaries .
Broz moved from the position of Prime Minister to President on 14 January 1953 and was subsequently re - elected on 29 January 1954 and 19 April 1958 .
The 1963 constitution specifically gave Broz an unlimited number of terms .
It also defined a new office of President of the Federal Executive Council which would head that institution rather than the President .
Broz could still convene the Federal Executive Council , remained head of state and commander - in - chief of the armed forces , and concurrently still served as head of the communist party .
He was re - elected by the Federal Assembly under this system again in 1963 and 1968 .
Constitutional amendments in 1971 created a new collective presidency consisting of republican representatives , still presided over by the President of the Republic .
The 1974 constitution gave the then 82-year old Broz an unlimited mandate , making him president - for - life .
It also created a new rotating office of President of the Presidency which would take effect in the event of Broz 's death .
The sitting Vice President of the Presidency would succeed him in this case .
This eventually occurred on 4 May 1980 when Lazar Koliševski became the first President of the Presidency upon Broz 's death .
Deanolis sublimbalis , the red banded mango caterpillar , is a species of moth of the Crambidae family .

In 1990 it was first recorded in Australia in the Torres Strait and in 2001 it was detected on the Australian mainland in the Northern Peninsula Area at the tip of the Cape York Peninsula in Queensland .
The wingspan is about 20   mm .
The forewings have a white ground colour interspersed with darker scales .
The ground colour of the hindwings is white .
The larvae are a serious pest of Mangifera indica fruit , but have also been recorded feeding on Mangifera minor and Mangifera odorata .
They hatch and burrow into the distal end of the mango fruit .
Larvae pass through five instars within the fruit , with a larval development period of 14 to 20 days .
Early instars feed on the fruit pulp forming a network of tunnels which may eventually cause the fruit to collapse .
Later instars feed on the seed .
Up to eleven larvae have been found in a single fruit , but there is mostly only one larva in a single fruit .
Civilization Phaze III is the sixty - third album by Frank Zappa , released posthumously as a double album on October 31 , 1994 .
It was the first studio album of new material from Zappa since 1986 's Jazz from Hell .
The album marks the third part of a conceptual continuity that started with We 're Only in It for the Money ( 1968 ) , with the second part being a re - edited version of Zappa 's 1967 album Lumpy Gravy .
Zappa described the album as a " two - act opera " , but in lieu of traditional recitatives and arias , it alternates brief spoken word passages with musical numbers created on a Synclavier using a combination of sampled and synthesized sounds .
Much of the sampled material in the second half of the album was originally recorded by Ensemble Modern and other musicians to Zappa 's specifications .
The storyline of Civilization Phaze III involves a group of people living inside a piano , and the menacing reality of the outside world .
The album 's themes include personal isolation and nationalism .
Much of the album 's improvised dialogue was originally recorded as part of sessions which produced We 're Only in It for the Money and Uncle Meat , which contained some dialogue by the same speakers , and some of the dialogue on this album previously appeared on the re - edited version of Lumpy Gravy released in 1968 .
New dialogue was recorded by Zappa in 1991 , and includes similarly improvised dialogue by members of Ensemble Modern , Zappa 's daughter Moon Unit and actor Michael Rapaport .

The Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team appeared for the first time in a FIFA World Cup at the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil , and remains the only time the team participated at a major international tournament to date .
Although Serbia is accepted by FIFA as the official successor of Yugoslavia , Bosnian players have played a role in World Cup history before their independence in 1992 .
Yugoslavia qualified for the World Cup eight times between 1930 and 1990 .
While in the early editions Yugoslavia was mainly represented by Serbs , the squads grew more inclusive over time .

The diplomacy of the American Civil War involved the relations of the United States of America and the Confederate States of America with the major world powers during the American Civil War of 1861 – 1865 .
The United States successfully prevented other powers from recognizing the Confederacy , which counted heavily on Britain and France to enter the war on its side to maintain their supply of cotton and to weaken a growing opponent .
Every nation was officially neutral throughout the war , and none formally recognized the Confederacy .
The major nations all recognized that the Confederacy had certain rights as an organized belligerent .
A few nations did take advantage of the war .
Spain recaptured its lost colony of the Dominican Republic .
It lost it again in 1865 .
More serious was the war by France , under Emperor Napoleon III , to install Maximilian I of Mexico as a puppet ruler , hoping to negate American influence .
France , therefore , encouraged Britain to join in a policy of mediation , suggesting that both recognize the Confederacy .
Washington repeatedly warned that any recognition of the Confederacy was tantamount to a declaration of war .
The British textile industry depended on cotton from the South , but it had stocks to keep the mills operating for a year and in any case , the industrialists and workers carried little weight in British politics .
Knowing a war would cut off vital shipments of American food , wreak havoc on the British merchant fleet , and cause the immediate loss of Canada , Britain and its powerful Royal Navy , refused to go join France .
Historians emphasize that Union diplomacy proved generally effective , with expert diplomats handling numerous crises .
British leaders had some sympathy for the Confederacy , but were never willing to risk war with the Union .
France was even more sympathetic to the Confederacy , but it was threatened by Prussia and would not make a move without full British cooperation .
Confederate diplomats were inept , or as one historian put it , " Poorly chosen diplomats produce poor diplomacy . "
Other countries played a minor role .
Russia made a show of support of the Union , but its importance has often been exaggerated .

Schnecken are a type of sweet bun that was a traditional Saturday morning treat in German homes at the beginning of the 20th century and that was commonly found in Jewish immigrant communities in the United States ( Philadelphia and Baltimore ) or German immigrant communities in Southern Brazil ( where they 're spelled chineque ) .
The name schnecken means snails in German and refers to the shape of the pastry .
The bun is still common in Germany , where the name is Schnecke ( which is the German singular of schnecken ) , and in other parts of northern Europe .
Schnecken are commonly confused with rugelach , an eastern European ( Poland , Russia , Ukraine ) Jewish bun that is different in two respects :
( 1 ) Schnecken dough is made with sour cream , while rugelach is made with cream cheese .
( 2 ) Schnecken are rolled into a cylinder and sliced , becoming a flat spiral , whereas rugelach are formed from individual triangles of dough and rolled into a croissant shape .
Because the vast majority of American Jews are descendants of immigrants from Poland , Russia and the Ukraine , it 's more common to see these pastries labeled as rugelach rather than schnecken in delis and bakeries .

Pasquale Cicogna was the Doge of Venice from 1585 to 1595 .
He supported the claim of Henry of Navarre to the French throne , and convinced Pope Sixtus V to support Henry in exchange for his conversion to Catholicism .
He broke with tradition by scattering silver coins , rather than gold ducats , to the crowd during his coronation procession .
These coins were known from then on as cicognini .
As his reign of Doge continued his popularity increased because he was very diplomatic and able to tackle major problems with great success .
Arguably , one of his greatest successes was converting the Rialto Bridge , one of Venice 's major landmarks and the only bridge over the Grand Canal of Venice , from wood to stone between 1588 and 1591 .
Although greater names such as Michelangelo had submitted designs , Pasquale chose the more humble architect Antonio da Ponte and his nephew Antonio Contin to design and rebuild the Rialto Bridge .
After Pasquale Cicogna died of a fever in 1595 a memorial was in scribed on the bridge to the Doge .
His dogaressa was Laura Morozini .
Clare Palmer ( born 1967 ) is a British philosopher , theologian and scholar of environmental and religious studies who is currently a professor in the Department of Philosophy at Texas A&M ; University .
She has previously held academic appointments at the University of Greenwich , the University of Stirling , Lancaster University and Washington University in St. Louis , among others .
Palmer is known for her work in environmental and animal ethics .
She has published three sole - authored books — Environmental Ethics ( ABC - CLIO , 1997 ) , Environmental Ethics and Process Thinking ( Oxford University Press , 1998 ) and Animal Ethics in Context ( Columbia University Press , 2010)—as well as the co - authored Companion Animal Ethics ( Wiley - Blackwell , 2015 ) and seven sole- or co - edited collections .
She is a former editor of the religious studies journal Worldviews : Environment , Culture , Religion , and a former president of the International Society for Environmental Ethics .
In Environmental Ethics and Process Thinking , which was based on her doctoral research , Palmer explores the possibility of a process philosophy - inspired account of environmental ethics , focussing on the work of Alfred North Whitehead and Charles Hartshorne .
She ultimately concludes that a process ethic is not a desirable approach to environmental questions , despite the fact that process thought has been co - opted by some environmentalist thinkers .
In Animal Ethics in Context , Palmer asks about responsibilities to aid animals , in contrast to the typical focus in animal ethics on not harming animals .
She defends a contextual , relational ethic according to which humans will typically have duties to assist only domestic , and not wild , animals in need .
However , humans will often be permitted to assist wild animals , and may be obligated to do so if there is a particular ( causal ) relationship between humans and the animals ' plight .

The League aimed exposure and " fight every effort to set up the tyranny of a minority over a majority . "
The League 's founding was announced on 3 March 1920 in an open letter published in The Times :
Bolshevism is the reverse of what mankind has built up of good by nearly two thousand years of effort .
It is the Sermon of the Mount writ backward .
It has led to bloodshed and torture , rapine and destruction .
It repudiated God and would build its own throne upon the basest passions of mankind . There are some misguided people of righteous instincts in this country who believe in Bolshevism ; there are others who have been influenced by secret funds;there are many who hope to fish in its bloodstained waters … If it is allowed to conquer it will mean in the end the destruction of individual rights , the family , the nation , and the whole British Commonwealth , together with the handing over of all we hold sacred into the power of those who stand behind and perhaps have fashioned this monstrous organization … The first we hope to be able to supply ; the second we ask you to help us obtain .
We desire in a clean and open fashion to fight what we believe to be a great and terrible evil , by means of letting light into its dark places .
We believe in the old adage --- that the Truth is great and will prevail ; but we believe also that this light should not be hid under a bushel .
We are certain that at bottom the British workman is sound and upright and that he does not desire to see in England , that ancient home of liberties , such conditions as prevail in Russia .

Lex Antonia ( Latin for Antonine law , sometimes presented plurally as the leges Antoniae , Antonine laws ) was a law established in ancient Rome in April 44 BC .
It was proposed by Mark Antony and passed by the Roman Senate , following the assassination of Julius Caesar .
It formally abolished the Dictatorship .
It was the second law to do so ( the first being passed after the Second Punic War , replacing the Dictatorship with the final decree of the Senate ) ; however , the earlier law had essentially been nullified by the subsequent Dictatorships of Sulla and Caesar .
The lex Antonia was mainly intended to provide Antony , who was beginning his consolidation of power , with some support from the Senatorial class , who had been alienated by the perpetual Dictatorships of Sulla and ( especially ) Caesar .
In the end , this law did not succeed either , for in 22 BC the Senate offered Caesar Augustus the Dictatorship ; however , he declined .
The Silesian Wars ( ) were a series of three wars fought in the mid-18th century between Prussia ( under King Frederick the Great ) and Austria ( under Empress Maria Theresa ) for control of Silesia , all three of which ended in Prussian victory .
The First ( 1740 – 42 ) and Second ( 1744 – 45 ) Silesian Wars formed a part of the larger War of the Austrian Succession , while the Third Silesian War ( 1756 – 63 ) was one theater of the Seven Years ' War .
Besides its value as a source of tax revenue , industrial output and military recruits , Silesia was strategically important to Prussia because its seizure " significantly blunted the capacity of Prussia 's two chief foes — Austria and Russia — to meddle in Prussian affairs . "
Capture of Silesia , furthermore , prevented Augustus III of Poland from uniting his two realms of Poland and Saxony via a land bridge through Silesia .
Prussia 's repeated victories ( and possession of Silesia ) foreshadowed a wider Austro - Prussian struggle for hegemony over the German - speaking peoples that would culminate in the Austro - Prussian War of 1866 .

Saʾīd ibn al-ʿĀs ibn Umayya ( died 678/679 ) was the Muslim governor of Kufa under Caliph Uthman ( r. 644 – 656 ) and governor of Medina under Caliph Mu'awiya I ( r. 661 – 680 ) .
Like the aforementioned caliphs , Sa'id belonged to the Banu Umayya clan of Quraysh .
During his governorship of Kufa , Sa'id led military campaigns in Azerbaijan and near the Caspian Sea .
However , he had to contend with dissent from some of the Kufan elite , led by Malik ibn al - Ashtar .
The dissent was largely driven by Sa'id and Uthman 's policy of consolidating ownership of the productive Sawad lands of Iraq into the hands of the Quraysh and Muslim veterans from Medina .
Sa'id had the dissidents exiled , but during a visit to Medina , rebels in Kufa led by Yazid ibn Qays al - Arhabi took control of the city .
After his ouster from Kufa , Sa'id aided in the defense of Uthman 's house from attack by Egyptian rebels , but Uthman was killed nonetheless and Sa'id was wounded .
He declined to fight alongside the Banu Umayya and Aisha against Caliph Ali ( r. 656 – 661 ) during the First Fitna , an act for which he was favorably remembered in Islamic historiography .
He was appointed governor of Medina by the Umayyad caliph Mu'awiya I in 669 , but replaced by Marwan ibn al - Hakam in 674 .
Sa'id then retired to his estate outside the city where he died .
One of his sons , Amr al - Ashdaq , succeeded him as leader of his clan .

James White ( 1747 – August 14 , 1821 ) was an American pioneer and soldier who founded Knoxville , Tennessee , in the early 1790s .
Born in Rowan County , North Carolina , White served as a captain in the county 's militia during the American Revolutionary War .
In 1783 , he led an expedition into the upper Tennessee Valley , where he discovered the future site of Knoxville .
White served in various official capacities with the failed State of Franklin ( 1784–1788 ) before building White 's Fort in 1786 .
The fort was chosen as the capital of the Southwest Territory in 1790 , and White donated the land for a permanent city , Knoxville , in 1791 .
He represented Knox County at Tennessee 's constitutional convention in 1796 .
During the Creek War ( 1813 ) , White served as a brigadier general in the Tennessee militia .

The Laser Clay Shooting System ( レーザークレー射撃システム ) is a light gun shooting simulation game created by Nintendo in 1973 .
The game consisted of an overhead projector which displayed moving targets behind a background ; players would fire at the targets with a rifle , in which a mechanism of reflections would determine whether or not the " laser shot " from the rifle hit the target .
The concept behind the Laser Clay Shooting System came from Hiroshi Yamauchi , while Gunpei Yokoi was behind the development of the system .
It was released in deserted bowling alleys in Japan in 1973 ; upon release , it was a commercial success .
However , the success of the system quickly evaporated as a result of the 1973 oil crisis and the ensuing recession in Japan , which left Nintendo   billion in debt and on the verge of bankruptcy .
In 1974 , Yamauchi , in an attempt to revive Nintendo , released a smaller , cheaper version of the Laser Clay Shooting System , titled " Mini Laser Clay " .
Deployed mostly in arcades , players shoot moving targets , provided by a 16 mm film projector , at an arcade cabinet .
This system featured several games and achieved significant success for Nintendo throughout the mid to late 1970s , which helped the company out of its financial situation .
The nuclear weapons debate refers to the controversies surrounding the threat , use and stockpiling of nuclear weapons .
Even before the first nuclear weapons had been developed , scientists involved with the Manhattan Project were divided over the use of the weapon .
The only time nuclear weapons have been used in warfare was during the final stages of World War II when United States Army Air Forces B-29 Superfortress bombers dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in early August 1945 .
The role of the bombings in Japan 's surrender and the U.S. 's ethical justification for them have been the subject of scholarly and popular debate for decades .
Nuclear disarmament refers both to the act of reducing or eliminating nuclear weapons and to the end state of a nuclear - free world .
Proponents of disarmament typically condemn a priori the threat or use of nuclear weapons as immoral and argue that only total disarmament can eliminate the possibility of nuclear war .
Critics of nuclear disarmament say that it would undermine deterrence and make conventional wars more likely , more destructive , or both .
The debate becomes considerably complex when considering various scenarios for example , total vs partial or unilateral vs multilateral disarmament .

The Hauraki Plains are a geographical feature and non - administrative area located in the northern North Island of New Zealand , at the lower ( northern ) end of the Thames Valley .
They are located 75 kilometres south - east of Auckland , at the foot of the Coromandel Peninsula and occupy the southern portion of a rift valley bounded on the north - west by the Hunua Ranges , to the east by the Coromandel and Kaimai Ranges and the west by a series of undulating hills which separate the plains from the much larger plains of the Waikato River .
Broadly , the northern and southern parts of the Hauraki Plains are administered by the Hauraki District and the Matamata - Piako District respectively .
The alluvial plains have been built up by sediment deposited by the Piako and Waihou Rivers , which flow north to reach the sea at the Firth of Thames , and earlier by the ancestral Waikato River .
The resulting land is flat , peat - heavy , and partly swampy which has been converted into excellent land for dairy farming .
Economically , the dairy farming is the leading primary industry , supported by other grassland farming .
More recently , tourism in the Hauraki Plains region has been growing and the Hauraki Rail Trail , part of the New Zealand Cycle Trail , has been constructed in the Hauraki Plains .
The largest town fully within the Plains is Ngatea , with a smaller settlement of Turua .
The larger town of Paeroa is located on the eastern edge of the Hauraki Plains .
While there is no defined geographical southern boundary to the Hauraki Plains , this is generally taken as been a line between the towns of Te Aroha and Morrinsville , approximately following State Highway 26 .

Rhodesian passports were passports issued by the government of Rhodesia to its citizens for purposes of international travel .
They are no longer issued , having been superseded by Zimbabwean passports in 1980 , with the country 's reconstitution and renaming as Zimbabwe .
Rhodesian passports were ostensibly valid for travel by Rhodesians anywhere in the world , but in practice they were accepted by very few countries .
Following its Unilateral Declaration of Independence from Britain on 11 November 1965 , Rhodesia 's predominantly white minority government was unrecognised , causing the legality of its passports to become ambiguous .
From 1968 , United Nations Security Council Resolution 253 called on all UN member states to refuse entry to Rhodesian passport holders .
The passports continued to be accepted by some non - UN countries , such as Switzerland , as well as a few UN members , including Portugal and South Africa , but they were not recognised as legal by most foreign powers .
For example , when Rhodesian politicians travelled to the United States on official business during the 1970s they were issued visas on separate pieces of paper , their passports unstamped .
The dispute surrounding the passports made it difficult for many Rhodesians to travel overseas , and also impacted on Rhodesia 's entry into international sports competitions , such as the Olympic Games , the FIFA World Cup , and the Davis Cup .
Because a Rhodesian passport was of little use in practice , many Rhodesian citizens obtained documents issued by other governments , most commonly British passports , which according to a 1978 report from the International Committee of the Red Cross were held by over two - thirds of the country 's white population .
When the country was reorganised under black majority rule in June 1979 as Zimbabwe Rhodesia , its passports were renamed appropriately .
Following the Lancaster House Agreement of December 1979 and the imposition of temporary British rule , applications for Zimbabwe Rhodesian passports trebled ; Zambia announced in March 1980 that it would start accepting Zimbabwe Rhodesian travellers .
These passports continued to be issued for a few months following the recognised independence of Zimbabwe in 1980 , stopping only when stocks were exhausted .
Since then , Zimbabwean passports have been issued and used by the country 's citizens .
Camouflage passports purporting to be issued by Rhodesia have more recently become available for sale over the internet .

Tito Cittadini ( 1886 – 1960 ) was an Argentine painter .
He was born in Buenos Aires to Italian immigrants , and in 1907 he began the study of architecture in Buenos Aires .
He traveled to Europe in 1910 , and at that time decided to switch his study to painting .

Due to Anglada 's urging , Cittadini made several trips to Spain during this period , and in 1913 he made his first trip to Majorca .
The island captivated him , and it gradually became the central focus of his work .

Domingos Jorge Velho ( 1641 – 1705 ) was one of the most fierce and effective Portuguese bandeirantes .
He was born in Santana de Parnaíba , captaincy of São Paulo , to Francisco Jorge Velho and Francisca Gonçalves de Camargo .
He was responsible for the repression of several indigenous nations in Bahia and especially Piauí , which he is reputed to have been the first colonist to explore .
His greater fame , however , is due to his conquest of the Quilombo dos Palmares , in the hinterland of Alagoas , on behalf of João da Cunha Souto Maior , governor of Pernambuco .
Velho accepted the assignment and , in 1694 , with an army of Indians and mamelucos , European Native American offspring , overran the fortified city of Macacos , on the Serra da Barriga mountain .
According to the bishop of Olinda at the time , he did not speak Portuguese fluently but rather the língua geral , a Lingua franca based on Tupian languages spoken in Brazil at that time .
John Manuel Monteiro , a specialist on the subject , in Os Negros da Terra , explains that Velho not only spoke Portuguese but was indeed literate : " Actually Domingos not only spoke but he also wrote in Portuguese , what would be highly unusual for a Tapuia [ ... ] Domingos even wrote a letter to the Portuguese King , and his recognizable signature can be identified frequently in the civil registries of Santana de Parnaíba " .
Velho is reputed to have had several Indian concubines , but only married in old age .
He died in Piancó , captaincy of Paraíba .
His uncle of the same name was married to Izabel Pires de Monteiro : the Captain Salvador Jorge Velho and Simão Jorge Velho were born out of this union .

The book An Essay on the Principle of Population was first published anonymously in 1798 , but the author was soon identified as Thomas Robert Malthus .
The book predicted a grim future , as population would increase geometrically , doubling every 25 years , but food production would only grow arithmetically , which would result in famine and starvation , unless births were controlled .
While it was not the first book on population , it was revised for over 28 years and has been acknowledged as the most influential work of its era .
Malthus 's book fuelled debate about the size of the population in the Kingdom of Great Britain and contributed to the passing of the Census Act 1800 .
This Act enabled the holding of a national census in England , Wales and Scotland , starting in 1801 and continuing every ten years to the present .
The book 's 6th edition ( 1826 ) was independently cited as a key influence by both Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace in developing the theory of natural selection .
A key portion of the book was dedicated to what is now known as Malthus ' Iron Law of Population .
This name itself is retrospective , based on the iron law of wages , which is the reformulation of Malthus ' position by Ferdinand Lassalle , who in turn derived the name from Goethe 's " great , eternal iron laws " in Das Göttliche .
This theory suggested that growing population rates would contribute to a rising supply of labour that would inevitably lower wages .
In essence , Malthus feared that continued population growth would lend itself to poverty and famine .
In 1803 , Malthus published , under the same title , a heavily revised second edition of his work .
His final version , the 6th edition , was published in 1826 .
In 1830 , 32 years after the first edition , Malthus published a condensed version entitled A Summary View on the Principle of Population , which included responses to criticisms of the larger work .

" The Horla " ( French : Le Horla ) is an 1887 short horror story written in the style of a journal by the French writer Guy de Maupassant , after an initial , much shorter version published in the newspaper Gil Blas , October 26 , 1886 .
American horror writer H. P. Lovecraft , in his survey " Supernatural Horror in Literature " ( 1927 ) , provides his own interpretation of the story :
The story has been cited as an inspiration for Lovecraft 's own " The Call of Cthulhu " , which also features an extraterrestrial being who influences minds and who is destined to conquer humanity .
The word horla itself is not French , and is a neologism .
Charlotte Mandell , who has translated " The Horla " for publisher Melville House , suggests in an afterword that the word " horla " is a portmanteau of the French words hors ( " outside " ) , and là ( " there " ) and that " le horla " sounds like " the Outsider , the outer , the one Out There , " and can be transliterally interpreted as " the ' what 's out there ' " .
Alexandros Giotopoulos (; born 1944 in Paris ) is serving a sentence of life imprisonment , having been found guilty in 2003 of leading the Marxist Greek urban guerrilla group Revolutionary Organization 17 November ( 17N ) .
17N was responsible for several murders of prominent Greek and foreign politicians , journalists , diplomats and businessmen .
Giotopoulos was identified as its leader after the apprehension and confession of Savvas Xiros , another member of 17N , following a failed bombing attempt on a hydrofoil shipping company in Piraeus .
Giotopoulos denied the charges against him , and described himself as the victim of " an Anglo - American conspiracy " .
At the start of his appeal , in 2005 , he received support from left - wing organisations and personalities in France , where he was born , including Alain Krivine and Pierre Vidal - Naquet .
However , on May 3 , 2007 , his conviction and those of his 17N accomplices were sustained by the court of appeals .
Alexandros Giotopoulos was a prominent opponent of the Greek military junta of 1967 - 1974 .
He is the son of Demetris Giotopoulos , once a secretary of Leon Trotsky , also known as Witte , who was a leader of the Greek Trotskyist party of archeiomarxists .
The Labor Code of the Philippines is the legal code governing employment practices and labor relations in the Philippines .
It was enacted on Labor day , May 1 , 1974 by Late President of the Philippines Ferdinand Marcos in the exercise of his then extant legislative powers .
The Labor Code sets the rules for hiring and firing of private employees ; the conditions of work including maximum work hours and overtime ; employee benefits such as holiday pay , thirteenth - month pay and retirement pay ; and the guidelines in the organization and membership in labor unions as well as in collective bargaining .
The Labor Code contains several provisions which are beneficial to labor .
It prohibits termination of employment of Private employees except for just or authorized causes as prescribed in Article 282 to 284 of the Code .
The right to self - organization of a union is expressly recognized , as is the right of a union to insist on a closed shop .
Strikes are also authorized for as long as they comply with the strict requirements under the Code , and workers who organize or participate in illegal strikes may be subject to dismissal .
Moreover , Philippine jurisprudence has long applied a rule that any doubts in the interpretation of law , especially the Labor Code , will be resolved in favor of labor and against management .
The Labor Code has been amended numerous times since it was first enacted .
The most significant amendment was brought about by the passage of Republic Act ( R.A. ) 6175 , which was enacted on March 21 , 1989 , under the administration of President Corazon C. Aquino .
R.A. 6175 is also known as the Herrera Law and was authored by Senator Ernesto Herrera .
Senator Leticia Ramos Shahani also introduced amendments to strengthen prohibitions against discrimination against women .
Subsequent amendments were also introduced under the administration of President Fidel V. Ramos .

Reverse Course was a change in US government and Allied Occupation policy toward Japan during the post - World War II reconstruction .
Beginning roughly between 1947 and 1948 , it lasted until the end of the occupation in 1952 .
The impetus for the Reverse Course divides between global events and developments within Japan .
On the one hand , it is linked to the escalation of the Cold War , the Chinese Communist Revolution and the looming Korean War .
On the other hand , due to domestic inflation , the growth of poverty , and the expansion of leftist parties , Japan seemed ripe for communism to both the Japanese government and the leaders of the occupation — especially to the leader of the occupation , Douglas MacArthur .
The Reverse Course resembled Europe ’s Marshall Plan .
The occupation had begun with various moves toward democratization , including land reform , the purge of officials responsible for Japan 's ultra - nationalism , and the suppression of both the zaibatsu and the yakuza .
This extended to Japan 's new constitution , which included an article that barred the government from maintaining a standing army .
This constitution and related policies had been written by Rooseveltian New - Dealers .
The Reverse Course changed such policies in favor of the containment policy .

The battle in Berlin was an end phase of the Battle of Berlin .
While the Battle of Berlin encompassed the attack by three Soviet Army Groups to capture not only Berlin but the territory of Germany east of the River Elbe still under German control , the battle in Berlin details the fighting and German capitulation that took place within the city .
The outcome of the battle to capture the capital of the Third Reich was decided during the initial phases of the Battle of Berlin that took place outside the city .
As the Soviets invested Berlin and the German forces placed to stop them were destroyed or forced back , the city 's fate was sealed .
Nevertheless , there was much heavy fighting within the city as the Red Army fought its way , street by street , into the centre .
On 23 April 1945 , the first Soviet ground forces started to penetrate the outer suburbs of Berlin .
By 27 April , Berlin was completely cut off from the outside world .
The battle in the city continued until 2 May 1945 .
On that date , the commander of the Berlin Defence Area , General Helmuth Weidling , surrendered to the commander of the Soviet 8th Guards Army , Lieutenant - General Vasily Chuikov .
Chuikov was a constituent of Marshal Georgiy Zhukov 's 1st Belorussian Front .
Lake Wayne formed in the Lake Erie and Lake St. Clair basins around 12,500 years before present ( YBP ) when Lake Arkona dropped in elevation .
About below the Lake Warren beaches it was early described as a lower Lake Warren level .
Based on work in Wayne County , near the village of Wayne evidence was found that Lake Wayne succeeded Lake Whittlesey and preceded Lake Warren .
From the Saginaw Basin the lake did not discharge water through Grand River but eastward along the edge of the ice sheet to Syracuse , New York , thence into the Mohawk valley .
This shift in outlets warranted a separate from Lake Warren .
The Wayne beach lies but a short distance inside the limits of the Warren beach .
Its character is not greatly different when taken throughout its length in Michigan , Ohio , Pennsylvania and New York .
At the type locality in Wayne County , Michigan , it is a sandy ridge , but farther north , and to the east through Ohio it is gravel .
The results of the isostatic rebound area similar to the Lake Warren beaches .

Liquiñe is a town in Liquiñe Valley , in Panguipulli commune , Valdivia Province , Chile .
The area around the village is home to South America 's densest collection of hot springs .
There are literally hundred of sites where geothermal waters flow up out of the earth .
The water emerges from the ground at roughly 176 ° F ( 80 ° C ) .

Ctesiphon served as a royal capital of the Persian Empire in the Parthian and Sasanian eras for over eight hundred years .
Ctesiphon remained the capital of the Sasanian Empire until the Muslim conquest of Persia in 651 AD .
Ctesiphon developed into a rich commercial metropolis , merging with the surrounding cities along both shores of the river , including the Hellenistic city of Seleucia .
Ctesiphon and its environs were therefore sometimes referred to as " The Cities " ( Aramaic : Mahuza , , al - Mada'in ) .
In the late sixth and early seventh century , it was one of the largest cities in the world .
During the Roman – Parthian Wars , Ctesiphon fell three times to the Romans , and later fell twice during Sasanian rule .
It was also the site of the Battle of Ctesiphon in 363 AD .
After the Muslim invasion the city fell into decay and was depopulated by the end of the eighth century , its place as a political and economic center taken by the Abbasid capital at Baghdad .

The was an uprising in what is now Nagasaki Prefecture in southwestern Japan lasting from December 17 , 1637 , to April 15 , 1638 , during the Edo period .
It largely involved peasants , most of them Catholics .
It was one of only a handful of instances of serious unrest during the relatively peaceful period of the Tokugawa shogunate 's rule .
In the wake of the Matsukura clan 's construction of a new castle at Shimabara , taxes were drastically raised , which provoked anger from local peasants and rōnin ( samurai without masters ) .
Religious persecution of the local Catholics exacerbated the discontent , which turned into open revolt in 1637 .
The Tokugawa Shogunate sent a force of over 125,000 troops to suppress the rebels and , after a lengthy siege against the rebels at Hara Castle , defeated them .
In the wake of the rebellion , the Catholic rebel leader Amakusa Shirō was beheaded and the prohibition of Christianity was strictly enforced .
Japan 's national seclusion policy was tightened and official persecution of Christianity continued until the 1850s .
Following the successful suppression of the rebellion , the daimyō of Shimabara , Matsukura Katsuie , was beheaded for misruling , becoming the only daimyō to be beheaded during the Edo period .

He served as a theological and dogmatics professor in the Lviv college after himself having earned two doctorates in the course of his own studies .

Pope Leo XIII named him as its archbishop and he set to work prioritizing a range of different pastoral initiatives aimed at revitalizing the faith within people and also prioritizing ecumenical cooperation with other denominations .
Bilczewski aided his people throughout the onslaught of World War I organizing relief and food for those displaced and those who became refugees ; he likewise aided beggars and the homeless in his archdiocese .

Depicting a Chinese baby crying within the bombed - out ruins of Shanghai South Railway Station , the photograph became known as a cultural icon demonstrating Japanese wartime atrocities in China .

" Newsreel " Wong , also known as Wong Hai - Sheng or Wang Xiaoting , did not discover the identity or even the sex of the injured child , whose mother lay dead nearby .
One of the most memorable war photographs ever published , and perhaps the most famous newsreel scene of the 1930s , the image stimulated an outpouring of Western anger against Japanese violence in China .
Journalist Harold Isaacs called the iconic image " one of the most successful ' propaganda ' pieces of all time " .
Wong shot footage of the bombed - out South Station with his Eyemo newsreel camera , and he took several still photographs with his Leica .

This is a timeline of major famines on the Indian subcontinent during British rule from 1765 to 1947 .
The famines included here occurred both in the princely states ( regions administered by Indian rulers ) , British India ( regions administered either by the British East India Company from 1765 to 1857 ; or by the British Crown , in the British Raj , from 1858 to 1947 ) and Indian territories independent of British rule such as the Maratha Empire .
The total human population of British India was around 331 Million .
At least 55.1 million people may have died in famines during British rule , which was around 17 % of entire population .
Such death toll is similar to wiping out the entire south Korean population .
The year 1765 is chosen as the start year because that year the British East India Company , after its victory in the Battle of Buxar , was granted the Diwani ( rights to land revenue ) in the region of Bengal ( although it would not directly administer Bengal until 1784 when it was granted the Nizamat , or control of law and order . )
The year 1947 is the year in which the British Raj was dissolved and the new successor states of Dominion of India and Dominion of Pakistan were established .

The Repnin Sejm ( ) was a Sejm ( session of the parliament ) of the Polish – Lithuanian Commonwealth that took place between 1767 and 1768 in Warsaw .
This session followed the Sejms of 1764 to 1766 , where the newly elected King of Poland , Stanisław August Poniatowski , attempted with some successes to push through reforms to strengthen the government of the Commonwealth .
These reforms were viewed as dangerous by Poland 's neighbors , who preferred a weak Commonwealth and did not want to see it threaten their own political and military aspirations .

The Trojan Women ( , Trōiades ) , also known by its Latin title Troades , is a tragedy by the Greek playwright Euripides .
Produced in 415 BC during the Peloponnesian War , it is often considered a commentary on the capture of the Aegean island of Melos and the subsequent slaughter and subjugation of its populace by the Athenians earlier that year ( see History of Milos ) .
415 BC was also the year of the scandalous desecration of the hermai and the Athenians ' second expedition to Sicily , events which may also have influenced the author .
The Trojan Women was the third tragedy of a trilogy dealing with the Trojan War .
The first tragedy , Alexandros , was about the recognition of the Trojan prince Paris who had been abandoned in infancy by his parents and rediscovered in adulthood .
The second tragedy , Palamedes , dealt with Greek mistreatment of their fellow Greek Palamedes .
This trilogy was presented at the Dionysia along with the comedic satyr play Sisyphos .

Rockefeller Republicanism has been described as the last phase of the " Eastern Establishment " of the GOP , which had been led by New York governor Thomas E. Dewey .
The group 's powerful role in the GOP came under heavy attack in 1964 and it lost most of its influence .
At a discouraging point in the 1964 primary campaign against Barry Goldwater in California , political operative Stuart Spencer called on Rockefeller to " summon that fabled nexus of money , influence , and condescension known as the Eastern Establishment .
' You are looking at it , buddy , ' Rockefeller told Spencer .
' I am all that is left . ' "
Michael Lind contends that the ascendancy of the more conservative fusionist - wing of the Republican Party , beginning in the 1960s with Goldwater and culminating in the Reagan revolution in 1980 , prevented the establishment of a Disraelian one - nation conservatism in the United States .
In its current usage , the term refers to " [ a ] member of the Republican Party holding views likened to those of Nelson Rockefeller ; a moderate or liberal Republican " .

The Castle is mentioned in L'Histoire de Guillaume le Marechal ( ' History of William the Marshal ' ) wherein it describes King Stephen as besieging the castle in 1152 and holding Marshal 's son , William Marshal , as a hostage against Newbury 's surrender .
When the elder Marshal refused to comply , Stephen threatened to have the young boy catapulted over the walls .
John , ( " that child of hell and root of all evil " according to Henry of Huntingdon ) responded defiantly , " I have the anvils and the hammer to forge still better sons . "
King Stephen was n't so heartless though — he relented and the boy survived .
Despite appearing proudly on the town 's coat of arms , Newbury Castle does n't appear to have been built in Newbury , England at all , but four miles away in the village of Hamstead Marshall .
There , the mottes of three castles can be found , which would be consistent with the general tactics of siege warfare during this medieval period .

The Bandit War , or Bandit Wars , was a series of raids in Texas , started in 1910 before finally culminating in 1919 , that were carried out by Mexican rebels from the states of Tamaulipas , Coahuila , and Chihuahua .
Before 1914 , the Carrancista faction was responsible for most of the attacks , but in January 1915 rebels known as Seditionistas drafted the Plan of San Diego and began launching their own raids .
The plan called for a race war , to rid the American border states of their Anglo - American population , and the annexation of the border states to Mexico .
However , the Seditionistas were never able to launch a full - scale invasion of the United States so they resorted to conducting small raids into Texas .
Much of the fighting involved the Texas Ranger Division , though the United States Army also engaged in small unit actions with bands of Seditionist raiders .

The Yellowhead Highway ( ) is a major interprovincial highway in Western Canada that runs from Winnipeg to Graham Island off the coast of British Columbia via Saskatoon and Edmonton .
It stretches across the four western Canadian provinces of British Columbia , Alberta , Saskatchewan , and Manitoba and is part of the Trans - Canada Highway system and the larger National Highway System , but should not be confused with the more southerly , originally - designated Trans - Canada Highway .
The highway was officially opened in 1970 .
Beginning in 1990 , the green and white Trans - Canada logo was used to designate the roadway .
The highway is named for the Yellowhead Pass , the route chosen to cross the Canadian Rockies .
The pass , and the highway are named after a fur trader and explorer named Pierre Bostonais .
He had yellow streaks in his hair , and was nicknamed " Tête Jaune " ( Yellowhead ) .
Almost the entire length of the highway is numbered as 16 , except for the section in Manitoba that is concurrent with Trans - Canada Highway   1 .
The highway number " 16 " is also the number given to a branch of the Trans - Canada in New Brunswick ; Route 16 .
However , the numeric designation is strictly coincidental , and New Brunswick Route 16 is not part of the Yellowhead .

The National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics ( NACA ) was a U.S. federal agency founded on March 3 , 1915 , to undertake , promote , and institutionalize aeronautical research .
On October 1 , 1958 , the agency was dissolved , and its assets and personnel transferred to the newly created National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) .
NACA was an initialism , i.e.
it was pronounced as discrete letters , rather than as a whole word ( as was NASA during the early years after being established ) .
Among other advancements , NACA research and development produced the NACA duct , a type of air intake used in modern automotive applications , the NACA cowling , and several series of NACA airfoils which are still used in aircraft manufacturing .
During World War II , NACA was described as " The Force Behind Our Air Supremacy " due to its key role in producing working superchargers for high altitude bombers , and for producing the laminar wing profiles for the North American P-51 Mustang .
NACA was also key in developing the area rule that is used on all modern supersonic aircraft , and conducted the key compressibility research that enabled the Bell X-1 to break the sound barrier .

Yeongjo of Joseon ( 31 October 1694 – 22 April 1776 , reigned 16 October 1724 – 22 April 1776 ) was the 21st king of the Korean Joseon Dynasty .
He was the second son of King Sukjong .
His mother was Consort Suk of the Choi clan .
Before ascending to power , his name was Prince Yeoning .
In 1720 , a few months after the accession of his older brother , King Gyeongjong as the 20th King , Yeoning became the Royal Prince Successor Brother ( wangseje , 왕세제 ) .
This induced a large controversy between political factions .
Nevertheless , four years later , at the death of Gyeongjong , Yeongjo ascended the throne .
Yeongjo 's reign lasted 52 years and was marked by his persistent efforts to reform the taxation system of Joseon , rule by Confucian ethics , minimize and reconcile the factional fighting under his " Magnificent Harmony " Policy ( Tangpyeong , 蕩平 , 탕평 ) .
His reign was also marked by the highly controversial execution of his son , Prince Sado , in 1762 .

The recording featured Perry , his band , Lynn Taitt on guitar and The Sensations as backing singers .
It was recorded at Clifford Rae 's WIRL studio and appeared on the WIRL record label in Jamaica , then in the UK on Graeme Woodall 's Doctor Bird ( label ) ( DB 1073 ) , both pressings with " Something You 've Got " on the B - side .

The original version is on several compilation albums , both of Perry 's songs and reggae classics , but the song did not receive a full album release until a version appeared on Perry 's album Revelation ( 2010 ) .
The Wailers also released a song titled " Run for Cover " - their first release on Tuff Gong - but this was based on Lee Perry and Marley 's " Soul Rebel " , not on Perry 's " Run for Cover " .
This is a list of Supreme Court of the United States cases in the area of copyright law .
In the United States Constitution , the Copyright Clause in Article 1 , Section 8 endows Congress with the power to create a copyright system .
To avoid individual states ' attempts at creating their own copyright systems , Congress passed the Copyright Act of 1790 , based on Great Britain 's Statute of Anne .
Over the decades since , copyright in the United States has become a more complicated system with longer terms and more tests , and has been the subject of many decisions by the Court .
The Supreme Court was the source of a number of concepts in the field , including fair use , the idea - expression divide , the useful articles or separability doctrine , and the uncopyrightability of federal documents .
This list is a list solely of United States Supreme Court decisions about applying copyright law .
Not all Supreme Court decisions are ultimately influential and , as in other fields , not all important decisions are made at the Supreme Court level .
Many federal courts issue rulings that are significant or come to be influential , but those are outside the scope of this list .
Because they share a clause of the Constitution and much the same justifications , there is considerable overlap between patent and copyright jurisprudence .
As such , patent cases may appear in this list if they make their connections to copyright explicit in the opinions .

Certain associates of the former Philippine president and dictator Ferdinand Marcos have benefited from their friendship with Marcos - whether in terms of legal assistance , political favours , or facilitation of business monopolies , during the latter 's administration .
Marcos critics , and the local and international press began referring to these individuals as " cronies " during the latter days of the Marcos dictatorship , and the Philippine government - especially the Presidential Commission on Good Governance ( PCGG ) - continued using the term after the ouster of the Marcoses in 1986 .
These " cronies " were awarded government commissions , projects and funds , many of which were later investigated for corruption , misuse of funds , and disregard for the Philippine constitution .
Marcos ' cronies were given strategic positions both in the government and in private sectors , in order for the Marcoses to seize control of the major industries of the country .
Regional effects of global warming are long - term significant changes in the expected patterns of average weather of a specific region due to global warming .
The world average temperature is rising due to the greenhouse effect caused by increasing levels of greenhouse gases , especially carbon dioxide .
When the global temperature changes , the changes in climate are not expected to be uniform across the Earth .
In particular , land areas change more quickly than oceans , and northern high latitudes change more quickly than the tropics , and the margins of biome regions change faster than do their cores .
Regional effects of global warming vary in nature .
Some are the result of a generalised global change , such as rising temperature , resulting in local effects , such as melting ice .
In other cases , a change may be related to a change in a particular ocean current or weather system .
In such cases , the regional effect may be disproportionate and will not necessarily follow the global trend .
The increasing temperatures from greenhouse gases have been causing sea levels to rise for many years .
There are three major ways in which global warming will make changes to regional climate : melting or forming ice , changing the hydrological cycle ( of evaporation and precipitation ) and changing currents in the oceans and air flows in the atmosphere .
The coast can also be considered a region , and will suffer severe impacts from sea level rise .
The Arctic , Africa , small islands and Asian megadeltas are regions that are likely to be especially affected by future climate change .
Africa is one of the most vulnerable continents to climate variability and change because of multiple existing stresses and low adaptive capacity .
Climate change is projected to decrease freshwater availability in central , south , east and southeast Asia , particularly in large river basins .
With population growth and increasing demand from higher standards of living , this decrease could adversely affect more than a billion people by the 2050s .
Small islands , whether located in the tropics or higher latitudes , are already exposed to extreme weather events and changes in sea level .
This existing exposure will likely make these areas sensitive to the effects of climate change .
Chander Mohan Bishnoi , is the former Deputy Chief Minister of Haryana State in India .
He is son of Bhajanlal Bishnoi and brother of HJC president Kuldeep Bishnoi .
Bishnoi was educated at the Lawrence School , Sanawar .
He was dismissed from the State Cabinet for his prolonged absence from the office and resurfaced after marrying Anuradha Bali , alias Fiza ( ) and converting to Islam with her and adopting the name Chand Mohammad ( ) .
The conversion was merely to facilitate a legal second marriage , as Hindus / Sikhs are not allowed multiple marriages in India .
Some Muslim clerics protested the misuse of the tenets of Islam for " a marriage of convenience " .
For this act of bigamy , he was disowned by his father , Bhajanlal , who was the former Chief Minister of Haryana State .
On 29 January 2009 , Mohan left Ms. Bali , claiming that he still loved his first wife and his children and wanted to reunite with them .
He is believed to have moved to the Haryana city of Gurgaon at that time .
He converted back to Hinduism and was readmitted to the Bishnoi community at a brief ceremony held at the Bishnoi Mandir in Hisar on 28 July 2009 in presence of religious leaders .
Ms. Bali is a former Assistant Advocate General of Haryana who left her employment to marry Mohan in December 2008 .
She was found dead , apparently having committed suicide , on 6 August 2012 .
Australasian Science is a bimonthly science magazine published in Australia .
It contains a mixture of news items , feature articles and expert commentary .
Australasian Science is Australia 's longest - running scientific publication .
It was first published in 1938 as The Australian Journal of Science by the Australian National Research Council , which was the forerunner of the Australian Academy of Science .
In 1954 the journal was transferred to ANZAAS – the Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science .
Throughout this time the journal published the research of eminent Australian scientists , including Sir Douglas Mawson and Sir Frank Macfarlane Burnet , whose groundbreaking clonal selection theory was published in the journal in 1957 .
The journal has evolved considerably over the following decades .
Since merging in 1998 with a popular science magazine published by the University of Southern Queensland , the magazine has been published as Australasian Science .
Published by Control Publications and available in newsagents , it is the only magazine that is dedicated to Australian and New Zealand science .
Australasian Science 's patrons are Nobel Laureate Prof Peter C. Doherty and ABC broadcaster Robyn Williams .

A geologic era is a subdivision of geologic time that divides an eon into smaller units of time .
The Phanerozoic Eon is divided into three such time frames : the Paleozoic , Mesozoic , and Cenozoic ( meaning " old life " , " middle life " and " recent life " ) that represent the major stages in the macroscopic fossil record .
These eras are separated by catastrophic extinction boundaries , the P - T boundary between the Paleozoic and the Mesozoic and the K - Pg boundary between the Mesozoic and the Cenozoic .
There is evidence that catastrophic meteorite impacts played a role in demarcating the differences between the eras .
The Hadean , Archean and Proterozoic eons were as a whole formerly called the Precambrian .
This covered the four billion years of Earth history prior to the appearance of hard - shelled animals .
More recently , however , the Archean and Proterozoic eons have been subdivided into eras of their own .
Geologic eras are further subdivided into geologic periods , although the Archean eras have yet to be subdivided in this way .
OpenVMS is a closed - source , proprietary computer operating system for use in general - purpose computing .
It is the successor to the VMS Operating System ( VAX-11/VMS , VAX / VMS ) , that was produced by Digital Equipment Corporation , and first released in 1977 for its series of VAX-11 minicomputers .
The 11/780 was introduced at DEC 's Oct. 25 , 1977 annual shareholder 's meeting .
In the 1990s , it was used for the successor series of DEC Alpha systems .
OpenVMS also runs on the HP Itanium - based families of computers .
, a port to the x86 - 64 architecture is underway .
The name VMS is derived from virtual memory system , according to one of its principal architectural features .
OpenVMS is a proprietary operating system , but source code listings are available for purchase .
OpenVMS is a multi - user , multiprocessing virtual memory - based operating system ( OS ) designed for use in time - sharing , batch processing , and transaction processing .
When process priorities are suitably adjusted , it may approach real - time operating system characteristics .
The system offers high availability through clustering and the ability to distribute the system over multiple physical machines .
This allows the system to be tolerant against disasters that may disable individual data - processing facilities .
OpenVMS contains a graphical user interface ( GUI ) , a feature that was not available on the original VAX-11/VMS system .
Prior to the introduction of DEC VAXstation systems in the 1980s , the operating system was used and managed from text - based terminals , such as the VT100 , which provide serial data communications and screen - oriented display features .
Versions of VMS running on DEC Alpha workstations in the 1990s supported OpenGL and Accelerated Graphics Port ( AGP ) graphics adapters .
Enterprise - class environments typically select and use OpenVMS for various purposes including mail servers , network services , manufacturing or transportation control and monitoring , critical applications and databases , and particularly environments where system uptime and data access is critical .
System up - times of more than 10 years have been reported , and features such as rolling upgrades and clustering allow clustered applications and data to remain continuously accessible while operating system software and hardware maintenance and upgrades are performed , or when a whole data center is destroyed .
Customers using OpenVMS include banks and financial services , hospitals and healthcare , network information services , and large - scale industrial manufacturers of various products .
As of mid-2014 , Hewlett - Packard ( successor to DEC ) licensed the development of OpenVMS exclusively to VMS Software Inc. ( VSI ) .
VMS Software will be responsible for developing OpenVMS , supporting existing hardware and providing roadmap to clients .
The company has a team of veteran developers that originally developed the software during DEC 's ownership .
Lew Grade , Baron Grade , OStJ , KC*SS ( 25 December 1906   – 13 December 1998 ) , born Louis Winogradsky , was a British media proprietor and impresario .
Originally a dancer , and later a talent agent , Grade 's interest in television production began in 1954 when , in partnership , he successfully bid for franchises in the newly created ITV network , which led to the creation of Associated Television ( ATV ) .
Having worked for a time in the United States , he was aware of the potential for the sale of television programming to American networks , and a subsidiary , the Incorporated Television Company ( ITC ; commonly known as ITC Entertainment ) was formed with this specific objective in mind .
Grade had some success in this field with such series as Gerry Anderson 's various Supermarionation series such as Thunderbirds , Patrick McGoohan 's The Prisoner , and Jim Henson 's The Muppet Show .
Later , Grade invested in film production , but several expensive box office failures caused him to lose control of ITC , and ultimately resulted in the disestablishment of ATV after it lost its ITV franchise .

The Consumer Broadband and Digital Television Promotion Act ( or CBDTPA ) was a United States bill proposed in 2002 that would have prohibited any kind of technology that could be used to read digital content without digital rights management ( DRM)—which prohibits copying and reading any content under copyright without permission of the copyright owner .
The bill was known in early drafts as the Security Systems and Standards Certification Act ( or SSSCA ) , and was sometimes called the Consume But Do n't Try Programming Act .
The CBDTPA was proposed by South Carolina senator Fritz Hollings ( D - SC ) .
Senator Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) , chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee , had stated that he could " not support " the proposed legislation and , as chairman , intended to block consideration of the controversial bill .
This essentially killed the bill in 2002 .
Proposed penalties for violating the CBDTPA ranged from five to twenty years in prison , and fines between $ 50,000 and $ 1 million .
Richard Stallman criticized this act due to the restrictions that it would place in the immediate and long - term future on free software , dubbing the bill the " Consume But Do n't Try Programming Act . "
Other U.S. senators named as sponsors of the CBDTPA bill include :
John Breaux ( D - LA )
Dianne Feinstein ( D - CA )
Daniel Inouye ( D - HI )
Bill Nelson ( D - FL )
Ted Stevens ( R - AK )

The Villa of Livia ( Latin : Ad Gallinas Albas ) is an ancient Roman villa at Prima Porta , 12 km north of Rome along the Via Flaminia .
It was probably part of Livia Drusilla 's dowry she brought when she married the emperor Augustus , her second husband , in 39 BC .
It was her country residence complementing her house on the Palatine Hill in Rome .
Its Latin name , Villa Ad Gallinas Albas , referred to its breed of white chickens , but it was also famous for its laurel grove , which was said by Suetonius to have auspiciously omened origins .
The location was strategically important due to the iron - rich cliffs of red tuff that approach the river at this point , the confluence of several roads and the northern entrance to Rome .
The name Prima Porta ( First Door ) came from an arch of the aqueduct over the Via Flaminia that brought water to the villa and which travellers saw as the first indication of having reached Rome .
The villa occupied the height dominating the view down the Tiber Valley to Rome .
Some of the walling that retained its terraces may still be seen .
The Villa was built and modified in four stages , the earliest of Republican date , the latest of the time of Constantine the Great .
Hedges v. Obama was a lawsuit filed in January 2012 against the Obama administration and members of the U.S. Congress by a group including former New York Times reporter and current Truthdig columnist Christopher Hedges , challenging the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 ( NDAA ) .
The legislation permitted the U.S. government to indefinitely detain people " who are part of or substantially support Al Qaeda , the Taliban or associated forces engaged in hostilities against the United States " .
The plaintiffs contended that Section 1021(b)(2 ) of the law allows for detention of citizens and permanent residents taken into custody in the U.S. on " suspicion of providing substantial support " to groups engaged in hostilities against the U.S. such as al - Qaeda and the Taliban respectively that the NDAA arms the U.S. military with the ability to imprison indefinitely journalists , activists and human - rights workers based on vague allegations .
A federal court in New York issued a permanent injunction blocking the indefinite detention powers of the NDAA but the injunction was stayed by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals pending appeal by the Obama Administration .
On July 17 , 2013 , the Second Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the district court 's permanent injunction blocking the indefinite detention powers of the NDAA because the plaintiffs lacked legal standing to challenge the indefinite detention powers of the NDAA .
The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on April 28 , 2014 , leaving the Second Circuit decision intact .

The Sejny Uprising or Seinai Revolt ( , ) refers to a Polish uprising against the Lithuanian authorities in August 1919 in the ethnically mixed area surrounding the town of Sejny ( Lithuanian : Seinai ) .
When German forces , which occupied the territory during World War I , retreated from the area in May 1919 , they turned over administration to the Lithuanians .
Trying to prevent an armed conflict between Poland and Lithuania , the Entente drew a demarcation line , known as the Foch Line .
The line assigned much of the disputed Suwałki ( Suvalkai ) Region to Poland and required the Lithuanian Army to retreat .
While the Lithuanians retreated from some areas , they refused to leave Sejny ( Seinai ) , because of its major Lithuanian population .
Polish irregular forces began the uprising on August 23 , 1919 , and soon received support from the regular Polish Army .
After several military skirmishes , Polish forces secured Sejny and Lithuanians retreated behind the Foch Line .
The uprising did not solve the larger border conflict between Poland and Lithuania over the ethnically mixed Suwałki Region .
Both sides complained about each other 's repressive measures .
The conflict intensified in 1920 , causing military skirmishes of the Polish – Lithuanian War .
Sejny changed hands frequently until the Suwałki Agreement of October 1920 , which left Sejny on the Polish side .
The uprising undermined the plans of Polish leader Józef Piłsudski , who was planning a coup d'état in Lithuania to replace the Lithuanian government with a pro - Polish cabinet , that would agree to a union with Poland ( the proposed Międzymorze federation ) .
Because the Sejny Uprising had prompted the Lithuanian intelligence to intensify its investigations of Polish activities in Lithuania , they discovered plans for the coup and prevented it , arresting Polish sympathizers .
These hostilities in Sejny further strained the Polish – Lithuanian relations .
Eventually , Poland and Lithuania reached an agreement on a new border that left Sejny on the Polish side of the border .
The Polish – Lithuanian border in the Suwałki Region has remained the same since then ( with the exception of the World War II period ) .

The history of the cannon spans several hundred years .
The cannon was invented in China as early as the 12th century and traces its development from the fire lance , the ancestor of cannons and firearms .
They were among the earliest forms of gunpowder artillery , and over time replaced siege engines — among other forms of aging weaponry — on the battlefield .
Their use was first documented in the Middle East in the 13th century , and the first cannon in Europe were probably used in Iberia , during the wars amongst Christians and Muslim kingdoms in Spain , in the 13th century .
English cannon were first used during the Hundred Years ' War , at the Battle of Crécy , in 1346 .
It was during this period , the Middle Ages , that cannon became standardized , and more effective in both the anti - infantry and siege roles .
After the Middle Ages , most large cannon were abandoned , in favor of greater numbers of lighter , more maneuverable pieces .
In addition , new technologies and tactics were developed , making most defenses obsolete ; this led to the construction of star forts , specifically designed to withstand bombardment from artillery .
Cannon also transformed naval warfare : the Royal Navy , in particular , took advantage of their firepower .
As rifling became more commonplace , the accuracy of cannon was significantly improved , and they became deadlier than ever , especially to infantry .
In World War I , a considerable majority of all deaths were caused by cannon ; they were also used widely in World War II .
Most modern cannon are similar to those used in the Second World War , including autocannon — with the exception of naval guns , which are now significantly smaller in caliber .

White Butterfly is the second album from Essex alternative metal band InMe .
It was released on 20 June 2005 under the record label V2 Records .
Its highest UK chart position was # 56 , and reached # 1 on the UK rock album chart .
While the band 's style of music is still evident in White Butterfly , their sound has changed significantly since Overgrown Eden .
Dave McPherson 's vocals lack the raspy angst that can be heard on the previous album and he now sings in a softer , cleaner tone .
Several songs on White Butterfly also contain multiple chorused vocals that are evident in songs as " So You Know " and " Faster the Chase " , and one song that is sung almost entirely by Joe Morgan , " Almost Lost " .
The album also has a lighter tone compared to the considerably darker mood of Overgrown Eden which almost had a metal - type sound to it .
This would also be the last InMe studio album that would feature Joe Morgan .
Swabia (; , colloquially Schwabenland or Ländle ; in English also archaic Suabia or Svebia ) is a cultural , historic and linguistic region in southwestern Germany .
The name is ultimately derived from the medieval Duchy of Swabia , one of the German stem duchies , representing the territory of Alemannia , whose inhabitants interchangeably were called Alemanni or Suebi .
This territory would include all of the Alemannic German area , but the modern concept of Swabia is more restricted , due to the collapse of the duchy of Swabia in the thirteenth century .
Swabia as understood in modern ethnography roughly coincides with the Swabian Circle of the Holy Roman Empire as it stood during the Early Modern period , now divided between the states of Bavaria and Baden - Württemberg .
Swabians ( Schwaben , singular Schwabe ) are the natives of Swabia and speakers of Swabian German .
Their number was estimated at close to 0.8 million by SIL Ethnologue as of 2006 , compared to a total population of 7.5 million in the regions of Tübingen , Stuttgart and Bavarian Swabia .

In 1963 , Woods and WDAS radio station General manager Bob Klein chartered buses to take people down to the August 28 , 1963 March on Washington , D.C. ( subsequently famous for its " I Have a Dream " speech by Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr. ) and had asked a young Ed Bradley , who later went on to be a well - known CBS correspondent , to be a bus captain .

Pierre de la Broce or de la Brosse ( died 30 June 1278 ) was a royal favorite and councilor during the early reign of Philip III of France .
De la Broce was from a family of petty nobility in Touraine , and was a minor household official for Louis IX .
After Louis ' death in 1270 , de la Broce quickly became a favorite of the new king .
He accumulated a substantial fortune , built from Philip 's largesse and from gifts from those hoping to cultivate his influence with the king .
This influence was greatly resented by many of the nobility and by associates of the Queen .
In 1277 letters allegedly written by de la Broce were presented to Philip , which caused the king to have de la Broce arrested .
He was finally hanged six months later .
No trial was held , and the evidence was apparently suppressed , so the contents of the letters are unknown .
Evidence has been put forward that de la Broce was framed .
Darkman is a 1990 American superhero film directed and co - written by Sam Raimi .
It is based on a short story Raimi wrote that paid homage to Universal 's horror films of the 1930s .
The film stars Liam Neeson as Peyton Westlake , a scientist who is attacked and left for dead by a ruthless mobster , Robert Durant ( Larry Drake ) , after his girlfriend , an attorney ( Frances McDormand ) , runs afoul of a corrupt developer ( Colin Friels ) .
Unable to secure the rights to either The Shadow or Batman , Raimi decided to create his own superhero and struck a deal with Universal Studios to make his first Hollywood studio film .
It was produced by Robert Tapert , and was written by Raimi , his brother Ivan Raimi and Chuck Pfarrer .
The design and creation of the makeup effects required to turn Liam Neeson into Darkman were the handiwork of makeup effects artist Tony Gardner , who also cameos in the film as the Lizard Man in the carnival Freak Show sequence .
Darkman was generally well received by critics and performed well at the box office , grossing almost $ 49 million worldwide , well above its $ 16 million budget .
This financial success spawned two direct - to - video sequels , ( 1995 ) and ( 1996 ) , as well as comic books , video games , and action figures .
Over the years , Darkman has become regarded as a cult film .
Neeson does not reprise his role for the direct - to - video sequels .

Eaton 's Corrasable Bond is a trademarked name for a brand of erasable typing paper .
Erasable paper has a glazed or coated surface which is almost invisible , is easily removed by friction , and accepts typewriter ink fairly well .
Removing the coating removes the ink on top of it , so mistakes can be easily erased once .
After erasure , the correction is typed onto an unprotected paper surface and can not be easily erased a second time .
Because the coated surface does not absorb ink , erasable paper is apt to smudge .
Since the coating is intended to be easily removed by friction , the typed pages are not very durable .
Under some storage conditions , the coating is apt to make pages stick together .
Erasable paper is not suitable for legal documents or archival records .
It was available in a number of thicknesses .
Eaton 's Corrasable Bond is no longer manufactured .
In the United States , Eaton 's Corrasable Bond was a very familiar brand of erasable typing paper during the mid-1950s and 1960s , and " corrasable " became almost a generic name for erasable typing paper .
For example , in prohibiting the use of such paper for manuscript submissions , the Linguistic Society of America refers to " Eaton 's ' Corrasable Bond ' and similar brands . "
Writer Peter David , who worked as an editor 's assistant at the E. P. Dutton imprint Elsevier / Nelson before becoming a professional writer , once related finding a submission written on erasable bond , which made the print difficult to read .
In a 1992 Comics Buyer 's Guide column in which he provided aspiring writers with tips on composing submissions , he stated , " Do n't write on anything other than standard - weight white bond paper .
I do n't care what Abe Lincoln or Jack Kerouac wrote on ; you 're not Lincoln or Kerouac .
And for crying out loud , do n't use erasable bond .
That was n't a dodge the writer used in Misery to get Annie out of the house ; no real writer types on erasable bond . "

Bitaqat Hub ( Arabic : بطاقة حب , English translation : " Love card " , also transliterated Bitaqat Hub , Bitaqat Hob , Bitakat Hob and in many other manners ) was the Moroccan entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1980 , performed in Arabic by Samira .
The song is notable in the history of the Eurovision Song Contest since this was Morocco 's first ( and , to date , only ) appearance at the Contest .
Consequently , this was also the first - and only - entry to be performed entirely in Arabic , to represent a geopolitically African country ( Malta , while geographically part of the African plate is geopolitically in Europe ) and to represent an Arab world country .
The reason for these apparent anomalies is that entry to the Eurovision Song Contest is open to all members of the European Broadcasting Union , a group containing states in North Africa and the Middle East .
Indeed , Tunisia had intended to compete in the Eurovision Song Contest 1977 , and would therefore have been involved in many of these " firsts " had it not pulled out beforehand .
Subsequently , Lebanon also intended to compete in 2005 and had selected and recorded a song before withdrawing being unable to guarantee the broadcast of the Israeli entry , a move which incurred a fine and a ban from the contest until 2009 .
The song itself is a moderately up - tempo number , with clear influences from western disco but with Arabic overtones .
Samira sings of the need for peace among the nations of the world , taking the role of " the children of the world " in order to describe a vision of a war - free , hatred - free society in which " Life is now full of peace " .
The song was performed fifth on the night .
At the close of voting , it had received 7 points , all of them from Italy , placing 18th in a field of 19 - ahead of perennial last - place recipient Finland .
Due to the poor finish , Morocco 's then - king Hassan II is reported to have decreed that the country would not return in subsequent years .
Additionally , given the presence of Israel in the Contest ( Israel having opted out of the 1980 edition , which they were eligible to host , as it was scheduled on the Israeli Memorial day eve ) , it is unlikely that any further Moroccan entries will be forthcoming .
The result did not affect Samira 's career , as she went on to become a leading recording star of the Arab world .

The Fortified Sector of the Sarre ( Secteur Fortifié de la Sarre ) was the French military organization that in 1940 controlled the section of the Maginot Line on either side of the Sarre river .
The sector 's defenses relied primarily on a system of inundations that could be created by fortified dikes and regulating weirs , backed by blockhouses .
Weakly defended compared with other sections of the Maginot Line , the sector received a measure of attention and funding from the mid-1930s when the formerly demilitarized Saarland was reintegrated into Germany .
However , with a single petit ouvrage it remained a weak point in the Line .
In 1940 the Sarre sector was attacked by German forces in the Battle of France .
The inundations were only partly successful , and German forces were able to pierce the Maginot Line at the Sarre , allowing German divisions to move behind the main French line .

Zhongzheng or Chungcheng ( ) is a common name for places , roads , schools or organizations in Chinese - speaking areas , though today predominantly in Taiwan .
The majority of these places and things are named after Chiang Chung - cheng , the preferred given name of Chiang Kai - shek .

The former spelling has been standard in Taiwan since 2009 and in mainland China since 1958 .
Between about 2002 and 2009 in Taiwan , the variant " Jhongjheng " ( using the tongyong pinyin system ) was also seen .
Other variations , using informal transcriptions , sometimes omit either instance of the letter " g " , or use " u " and " o " interchangeably .

Berenguer Ramon II " the Fratricide " ( 1053/1054   – 1097/1099 ) was Count of Barcelona from 1076 to 1097 .
He was the son of Ramon Berenguer I , and initially ruled jointly with his twin brother Ramon Berenguer II .
Born in 1053 or 1054 , Berenguer Ramon succeeded his father Ramon Berenguer I the Old in 1075 to co - rule with his twin brother Ramon Berenguer II .
The twins failed to agree and divided their possessions between them , against the will of their late father .
Ramon Berenguer II was killed while hunting in the woods on 5 December 1082 .
Berenguer Ramon II , who became the sole ruler of Catalonia for the next four years , was credited by popular opinion with having orchestrated this murder .
This suspicion and other divisions of loyalty led to a civil war .
Various parties asserted ways to resolve this ' unjust and iniquitous murder ' , which led to a moderate compromise in 1086 in which Berenguer Ramon II would rule Catalonia with his brother 's four - year - old son Ramon Berenguer III for eleven years until he came of age .
In the 1080s Berenguer Ramon 's involvement in the internal strife in the Moorish taifa kingdoms brought him in conflict with El Cid .
In the ensuing war the Count of Barcelona was twice taken prisoner .
After Berenguer Ramon 's resignation in 1097 his life became more obscure .
Still living under the accusations of his brother 's assassination , the guilt of which may have been determined by trial by combat , which he lost , he went to Jerusalem , either on pilgrimage , as a penance , or as part of the First Crusade , and perished there between 1097 and 1099 .
Berenguer Ramon II was succeeded by his nephew Ramon Berenguer III , son of Ramon Berenguer II .

The German Crown Jewels encompass the Imperial Regalia of the German Kingdom within the Holy Roman Empire until 1806 .
From 1871 until 1918 the Prussians kings redenominated the Prussian Crown Jewels as Crown jewels of the German Emperors .
Formally the German Empire had no physical Crown jewels , though a model of a German State Crown was created and used in emblems .
The term may also be used in reference to regalia of the various constitutive German monarchies that sprang from the Holy Roman Empire and later were unified in the German Empire .
Since the end of the German monarchies in 1918 , the regalia and jewels of the different states have been kept in museums since all of Germany remains under republican rule .
Zeami mixed a variety of Classical and Modern themes in his writing , and made use of Japanese and Chinese traditions .
He incorporated numerous themes of Zen Buddhism into his works and later commentators have debated the extent of his personal interest in Zen .
The exact number of plays that he wrote is unknown , but is likely to be between 30 and 50 .
He wrote many treatises about Noh , discussing the philosophy of performance .
These treatises are the oldest known works on the philosophy of drama in Japanese literature , but did not see popular circulation until the 20th - century .
After the death of Yoshimitsu , his successor Ashikaga Yoshimochi was less favorable to Zeami 's drama .
Zeami successfully sought out patronage from wealthy merchants and continued his career under their support .
He became well - known and well - respected in Japanese society .
Ashikaga Yoshinori became hostile toward Zeami after becoming Shōgun in 1429 .
Yoshinori held Zeami 's nephew Onnami in high regard , and disagreed with Zeami 's refusal to declare Onnami his successor as leader of his troupe .
Possibly due to this disagreement , though a variety of competing theories have been advanced , Yoshinori sent Zeami into exile to Sado Island .
After Yoshinori 's death in 1441 , Zeami returned to mainland Japan , where he died in 1443 .

The phrase to turn a blind eye is attributed to an incident in the life of Admiral Horatio Nelson .
Nelson was blinded in one eye early in his Royal Navy career .
During the Battle of Copenhagen in 1801 the cautious Admiral Sir Hyde Parker , in overall command of the British forces , sent a signal to Nelson 's forces ordering them to discontinue the action .
Naval orders were transmitted via a system of signal flags at that time .
When this order was brought to the more aggressive Nelson 's attention , he lifted his telescope up to his blind eye , saying , " I have a right to be blind sometimes .
I really do not see the signal , " and most of his forces continued to press home the attack .
The frigates supporting the line - of - battle ships did break off , in one case suffering severe losses in the retreat .
There is a misconception that the order was to be obeyed at Nelson 's discretion , but this is contradicted by the fact that it was a general order to all the attacking ships ( some of whom did break off ) , and that later that day Nelson openly stated that he had " fought contrary to orders " .
Sir Hyde Parker was recalled in disgrace and Nelson appointed Commander - in - Chief of the fleet following the battle .
The Oxford English Dictionary records usage of the phrase as early as 1698 .

Gladstonian liberalism is a political doctrine named after the British Victorian Prime Minister and leader of the Liberal Party , William Ewart Gladstone .
Gladstonian liberalism consisted of limited government expenditure and low taxation whilst making sure government had balanced budgets and the classical liberal stress on self - help and freedom of choice .
Gladstonian liberalism also emphasised free trade , little government intervention in the economy and equality of opportunity through institutional reform .
It is referred to as laissez - faire or classical liberalism in the United Kingdom and is often compared to Thatcherism .
Gladstonian financial rectitude had a partial lasting impact on British politics and the historian John Vincent contends that under Lord Salisbury 's premiership he " left Britain 's low tax , low cost , low growth economy , with its Gladstonian finance and its free trade dogmas , and no conscript army , exactly as he had found it ... Salisbury reigned , but Gladstone ruled " .
However , in the early 20th - century the Liberal Party began to move away from Gladstonian liberalism and instead developed new policies based on social liberalism ( or what Gladstone called " constructionism " ) .
The Liberal government of 1906 – 1914 is noted for its social reforms and these included old age pensions and National Insurance .
Taxation and public expenditure was also increased and New Liberal ideas led to David Lloyd George 's People 's Budget of 1909–1910 .
The first Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer , Philip Snowden , had Gladstonian economic views .
This was demonstrated in his first Budget in 1924 as government expenditure was curtailed , taxes were lowered and duties on tea , coffee , cocoa and sugar were reduced .
Historian A. J. P. Taylor remarked that this budget " would have delighted the heart of Gladstone " .
Ernest Bevin remarked on becoming Minister of Labour in 1940 : " They say that Gladstone was at the Treasury from 1860 to 1930 " .

The Fortner Mounds are a pair of Native American mounds in the central part of the U.S. state of Ohio .
Located northeast of the city of Pickerington in Fairfield County , they are two of several mounds in the Pickerington vicinity , but the only pair of mounds in the area .
As such , they are of special interest to archaeologists : some of the mound - building peoples of prehistoric North America lived in groups of two or three houses , which were often covered with piles of earth when the families would move to other places .
Therefore , it is likely that these mounds cover groups of postholes , and buried bodies may also be located within them .
From their shape , it is apparent that the mounds were constructed by people of the Adena culture , who lived in central Ohio between approximately 500 BC and AD 400 .
Because the Fortner Mounds are likely to cover both the remains of houses and of these houses ' inhabitants , they compose a significant archaeological site .
In recognition of their archaeological value , the two mounds were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in mid-1974 .
They are one of five Fairfield County mound sites to be included on the Register , along with the Theodore B. Schaer Mound near Canal Winchester , the Tarlton Cross Mound near Tarlton , the Coon Hunters Mound near Carroll , and the Old Maid 's Orchard Mound near Lithopolis .

The Ordnungspolizei encompassed virtually all of Nazi Germany 's law - enforcement and emergency response organizations , including fire brigades , coast guard , and civil defense .
In the prewar period , Reichsführer - SS Heinrich Himmler and Kurt Daluege , chief of the Order Police , cooperated in transforming the police force of the Weimar Republic into militarised formations ready to serve the regime 's aims of conquest and racial annihilation .
Police troops were first formed into battalion - sized formations for the invasion of Poland , where they were deployed for security and policing purposes , also taking part in executions and mass deportations .
During World War II , the force had the task of policing the civilian population of the conquered and colonized countries beginning in spring 1940 .
Orpo 's activities escalated to genocide with the invasion of the Soviet Union , Operation Barbarossa .
Twenty - three police battalions , formed into independent regiments or attached to Wehrmacht security divisions and Einsatzgruppen , perpetrated mass murder in the Holocaust and were responsible for widespread crimes against humanity and genocide targeting the civilian population .

The Rebellion Losses Bill ( full name : An Act to provide for the Indemnification of Parties in Lower Canada whose Property was destroyed during the Rebellion in the years 1837 and 1838 ) was a controversial law enacted by the legislature of the Province of Canada in 1849 .
Its passage and subsequent assent by the Governor General , James Bruce , 8th Earl of Elgin makes the bill a landmark piece of legislation in Canadian political history .
The bill was enacted to compensate Lower Canadians who lost property during the Rebellions of 1837 with measures similar to those providing compensation in Upper Canada .
Two factors made this measure controversial .
Even though participants in the Rebellion could not be compensated with taxpayer 's money , the sympathies for the Rebellion were more widespread in Lower Canada so that compensation in Lower Canada was seen as " giving money to the rebels " .
Secondly , the damage done by the army far exceed the damage done by the rebels so that provisions to compensate for damages done by the army was considered disloyal to the Crown .
The enactment of the bill angered some of Montreal 's Tory citizens and provoked weeks of violent disturbances known as the Montreal Riots .
It culminated in the burning of the Parliament building on April 25 which until then was in Montreal .

Operation Off Balance was a hastily planned offensive operation of the Laotian Civil War ; it happened between 1 and 15 July 1969 on the Plain of Jars in the Kingdom of Laos .
The Royal Lao Government forces in Military Region 1 of Laos had just been evicted from the crucial all - weather airfield at Muang Soui , as well as most of the Plain , on 28 June 1969 .
Hmong General Vang Pao planned a quick counter - offensive to recapture the airfield from his communist foe ; it would kick off on 1 July , supported by 60 sorties per day of tactical air strikes from Operation Barrel Roll .
In the event , the 1 July offensive ran afoul of its Neutralist allies , who retreated rather than carry out their assault .
A constant flow of reinforcements from the attacking People 's Army of Vietnam fed their own strength to resist .
With the Neutralists ' abstention , the remaining forces in Off Balance — two battalions of Hmong guerrillas and a Royalist paratrooper battalion— were defeated by counterattacking communist tanks supported by heavy artillery .
During the battle , the Hmong suffered the loss of their only fighter pilot , Lee Lue .
The reputation he had gained while flying over 5,000 combat missions had become the symbol of Hmong resistance ; his death was a crushing blow to Hmong morale .
Operation Off Balance ended the day of Lee Lue 's burial .
The communists still held the Plain of Jars and Muang Soui .

The Mary Murphy Mine was the principal gold mine of the Chalk Creek mining district of Chaffee County , Colorado , United States , near St. Elmo , Colorado .
The Mary Murphy Mine operated continuously from 1870 to 1925 , and produced 220 thousand ounces of gold , worth $ 4.4 million then ( or about $ 180,000,000 in 2008 ) , plus considerable silver , lead , and zinc .
There were two aerial tramways connecting the mine to Romley , Colorado and the Denver , South Park and Pacific Railroad .
In 1984 the Historic American Engineering Record recorded the structures then standing in the area .
Drainage from the old mine into Chalk Creek , a tributary of the Upper Arkansas River , would sometimes cause fish kills at the state - run fish hatchery downstream , such as the kill of 800,000 fingerling trout in 1986 .
The Colorado Division of Minerals and Geology consolidated all of the surface wastes and capped them in a “ high - and - dry ” spot on the mill site .
This reduced the dissolved metals levels enough to keep the fish kills from recurring .
Since then , the site has been used as test - bed for new ways to treat harmful drainage from abandoned mines in the Colorado Rockies .
The Mary Murphy Mine is a popular destination for four - wheelers and ghost - town enthusiasts .

Completely within the Fitzpatrick Wilderness , Dinwoody Glacier is one of the largest glaciers in the American Rocky Mountains , and as of 1989 was ranked fourth in area .
In a 1989 study which examined repeat photography and stream flow analysis , Dinwoody Glacier was determined to have retreated rapidly between 1958 and 1983 , though most of the reduction has been in the thickness of the glacier rather than its surface area .
In the same 25-year period , the glacier lost an average of in thickness .
Radar mapping of 72 locations on the glacier resulted in an average thickness of and a maximum measured depth of .
The 1989 study was commenced to examine the impact on water supplies to streams and rivers from glacier retreat of both Dinwoody and Gannett Glaciers .

The vegetation on the upper elevations of the Cedar Mountains is dominated by junipers ( referred to as " cedars " by early pioneers ) .
The foothill and valley regions include mixed desert shrubs .
Cheatgrass is prevalent over large areas burned by range fires .
The remains of an aragonite mining camp can also be found in the foothills .
The Cedar Mountain Wilderness includes more than half of the Cedar Mountain Herd Management Area , where feral horses have grazed since they were introduced in the late 19th century .
A survey conducted in December 1991 counted 444 horses , and parts of the herd can often be seen on the wilderness .
The Bureau of Land Management fills watering troughs for the horses when springs dry up in the summer .
This artificial water supply benefits other wildlife species such as pronghorn antelope .
The U.S. Congress designated the Cedar Mountain Wilderness primarily in response to an effort by members of the Utah congressional delegation and the Utah governor to block rail access to a proposed high - level nuclear waste storage facility on the nearby Skull Valley Indian Reservation .
The project was sponsored by a consortium of nuclear power companies known as Private Fuel Storage .
The project was killed in 2012 amid legal obstacles and substantial local opposition .

The Santa Ana Freeway is one of the principal freeways in Southern California , connecting Los Angeles and its southeastern suburbs including the freeway 's namesake , the city of Santa Ana .
The freeway begins at its junction with the San Diego Freeway ( Interstate 405 , I-405 ) , called the El Toro Y , in Irvine , signed as I-5 .
From there , it generally goes southeast to northwest to the East Los Angeles Interchange , where it takes the designation of U.S. Route 101 ( US   101 ) .
It then proceeds northwest to the Four Level Interchange ( also known as the Bill Keene Memorial Interchange ) in downtown Los Angeles .
Formerly , the entirety of the route was marked as US   101 until the 1964 highway renumbering , which truncated US   101 to the East Los Angeles Interchange and designated the rest of the freeway as I-5 .
North of the East Los Angeles Interchange complex , I-5 follows the Golden State Freeway .
South of the El Toro Y , I-5 takes on the San Diego Freeway name from I-405 .
An abundance of landmarks , most importantly Disneyland and Angel Stadium of Anaheim , along the Orange County portion of its route combines with a severe bottleneck beginning at the Los Angeles County line ( shrinking from 10 to 6 lanes ) to make it one of the most congested freeways in Southern California .
The infamously busy intersection of the Santa Ana , Garden Grove , and Orange freeways in southwestern Orange is nicknamed the Orange Crush .
The royal arms of Scotland is the official coat of arms of the King of Scots first adopted in the 12th century .
With the Union of the Crowns in 1603 , James VI inherited the thrones of England and Ireland and thus his arms in Scotland were now quartered with the arms of England ( which was itself quartered with France ) with an additional quarter for Ireland also added ( the arms would continue to alter in later years ) .
Though the kingdoms of England and Scotland would share the same monarch , the distinction in heraldry used in both kingdoms was maintained .
When the kingdoms of Scotland and England were united under the Acts of Union 1707 to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain , no single arms were created and instead , the royal arms as used in either Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom would continue to differ .
Poetically described as " the ruddy lion ramping in his field of tressured gold " , the arms are still widely used today as a symbol of Scotland , and are quartered in the royal arms of Queen Elizabeth II along with the arms of England and Ireland .
The arms in banner form is still used by various officials in Scotland and is called the Royal Banner , or more commonly , the Lion Rampant .

In Greek mythology , Itylus , or Itylos , was the son of Aedon , daughter of Pandareus of Ephesus and wife of King Zethus of Thebes .
Envious of Niobe , the wife of her husband 's brother Amphion , who had six sons and six daughters , she formed the plan of killing the eldest of Niobe 's sons , but by mistake slew her own son Itylus .
Zeus relieved her grief by changing her into a nightingale , whose melancholy tunes are represented by the poet as Aëdon 's lamentations about her child .
The mythic theme was an ancient one , for Homer 's listeners were expected to know the allusion , when Penelope reveals to the still- disguised Odysseus her anguish of a night:"I lie on my bed , and the sharp anxieties swarmingthick and fast on my beating heart torment my sorrowing self . As when Pandareos ' daughter , the greenwood nightingaleperching in the deep of the forest foliage sings outher lovely sing when springtime is just begun , she varyingthe manifold strains of her voice , pours out the melodymourning Itylos , son of the lord Zethos , her own belovedchild , whom she once killed with the bronze , when the madness was upon her;So my mind is divided , and starts one way , then another " ( Odyssey xix.519 - 24 ; Richard Lattimore 's translation ) .
As one of only nine similes in the Odyssey that are longer than five lines , the thematic complexity of the image and its multiple points of contact with Penelope 's situation has arrested the attention of many readers .
Aedon accidentally killed Itylus " in her madness " and was stricken with grief and guilt .
In pity , the gods turned her into a nightingale , which cries with sadness every night .
In an explanatory scholium on this passage , an anonymous scholiast , echoed by Eustathius , explains that Aedon attempted to kill the son of her sister - in - law and rival , Niobe , but accidentally killed her own son instead : thus , the gods changed her into a nightingale to weep for eternity .
The setting of the episode is Thebes .
Attic authors later than Homer , including the dramatists knew a nightingale myth in which Procne was married to Tereus , who betrayed her by violating her sister Philomela , whose tongue he cut out so that she could not tell .
( In some versions , Philomela is the name of the wife , Procne of her mutilated sister . )
Philomela wove her story into a robe that she gave to Procne .
In a fit of madness Procne murdered her own child by Tereus , Itys .
All were changed to birds , the murderous mother to a nightingale .

The United States Unified Medical Command was a proposed Unified Combatant Command within the United States Department of Defense .
The plan was rejected in December 2006 due to heavy resistance from Air Force Surgeon General Lieutenant General James G. Roudebush , who cited mission and cultural differences among the services as justification for keeping medical assets separate .
The unified command would have merged the medical assets of the United States Navy , Air Force , and Army and reduced the duplication of effort that currently exists .
The Department of Defense instead created a governance plan that creates joint oversight in four key areas : medical research , medical education and training , health care delivery in major military markets , and shared support services .
Specifically , the Department of Defense will implement the following measures :
Military medical research would become the responsibility of the Army Medical Research and Materiel Command at Fort Detrick , Maryland .
Enlisted military members from all services will receive medical training at a joint center at Fort Sam Houston , Texas .
Major military markets , particularly those in metropolitan areas such as San Antonio , Texas , and Washington , D.C. , will consolidate their operations and be the responsibility of a single service .
Support services such as information management and technology , facilities management , contracting and procurement , and logistical and financial functions will all be consolidated
To implement these changes , the Department of Defense will be creating a transition team to review options and recommend steps for implementation .
The implementation process is expected to take at least two years .
Additionally , the TRICARE Management Activity will be maintained , but with more focus on health insurance , contractor management and benefit delivery .
Other responsibilities such as information technology will be transferred to the support services command .

The Eurasian Economic Union ( EEU ) comprises 5 member states , which are party to the founding treaties of the EEU and thereby subject to the privileges and obligations of membership .
The constituent states of the EEU are placed under binding laws and have equal representation within the EEU 's executive and judicial bodies .
They do however retain considerable autonomy , and must be unanimous for the EEU to adopt policies or new member states .
Consensus is a founding principle of the EEU .
In 2000 six states created the EEU 's predecessor , the Eurasian Economic Community .
In 2010 three core states ( Russia , Belarus and Kazakhstan ) pursued integration and founded the Eurasian Customs Union and the Single Economic Space .
The three states are the founding members of the Eurasian Economic Union .
The remaining states have acceded in subsequent enlargements .
On 9 October 2014 Armenia signed the treaty and became the newest member state of the EEU on accession on 2 January 2015 .
Kyrgyzstan signed an accession treaty on 23 December 2014 , which came into on August 6 2015 .
Iran joined into a free trade agreement with the EEU on 24 April 2018 , following months of negotiations with Russia .
In the initial phase Iran will sell some 350 items to the bloc while another 180 items will be available in the Iranian market .
In order to accede , a state must fulfill the economic and political requirements .
Enlargement of the Union is also subject to the consent of all existing members and the candidate 's adoption of the existing body of EEU law and implementing previous decisions made by the Eurasian Commission , which become part of the EEU 's regulatory framework .

Public - private partnerships in Canada , ( PPP or P3 ) is a form of alternative service delivery ( ASD ) that involves a formal collaborative arrangement between the public and private sector in several initiatives .
This process can be done by pooling resources together to meet a common goal , or simply having the private sector focusing on carrying out specific societal responsibilities .
There are several subcategories that P3s can be grouped into .
The forms of P3s in Canada include : build – operate – transfer ( BOOT ) , company - owned - government - operated ( COGO ) , and government - owned - company - operated ( GOCO ) .
Public – private partnerships are commonly known for being used for infrastructure projects .
The history of P3 projects in Canada can be understood in two waves : the first wave ( 1990 – 2000 ) and the second wave ( 2000 – present ) .
Since its Canadian origins , over 220 projects have been facilitated .
The first and most commonly known examples of P3 projects are Highway 407 in Ontario , The Royal Ottawa Hospital , and the Confederation Bridge linking New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island .
The original rationale of P3s was to provide cities with top quality infrastructure without creating more direct public sector debt .
P3s work in theory because they make use of the expertise and innovation of the private sector and sometimes the incentive of capital market to enhance public projects .
In some situations , the private sector has better means than the public sector of delivering a service with efficiency .
Having P3s are meant to produce more gain rather than loss , whether economic or societal .
A lot of the risk involved in different projects , one being financial responsibility can either be shared , or put upon the private sector .
PPP Canada is a crown corporation developed by the government , with the duty of contracting out several services to the private sector , as well as provide funding on both federal and provincial levels .
P3s in Canada have received notable criticism from scholars , stakeholders , and the media .
The original complaints revolved around the issues of accountability , high up front cost , and the user fee rates of some projects .
Discrepancies between steering and rowing , level of public interest , labour relations , autonomy and accountability , and savings and performance are often topics of P3 debates .
Critics question how some the conflicting values and operations of the independent public and private sector effect the ability to achieve desired goals efficiently .
The most common debate is how the goal of economic gain in public sector values interacts with the public sector value of public good .
Evidence in favor of P3s and against P3s are available .

An ecclesiastical province is one of the basic forms of jurisdiction in Christian Churches with traditional hierarchical structure , including Western Christianity and Eastern Christianity .
In general , an ecclesiastical province consists of several dioceses ( or eparchies ) , one of them being the archdiocese ( or archeparchy ) , headed by metropolitan bishop or archbishop who has ecclesiastical jurisdiction over all other bishops of the province .
In the Greco - Roman world , ecclesia ( Greek , ekklēsiā ( Latin ecclesia ) meaning " congregation , church " ) was used to refer to a lawful assembly , or a called legislative body .
As early as Pythagoras , the word took on the additional meaning of a community with shared beliefs .
This is the meaning taken in the Greek translation of the Hebrew Scriptures ( the Septuagint ) , and later adopted by the Christian community to refer to the assembly of believers .
In the history of Western world ( sometimes more precisely as Greco - Roman world ) adopted by the Roman Empire and the Byzantine Empire , Christian ecclesiastical provinces were named by analogy with the secular Roman province as well as certain extraterritorial formations of western world in early medieval times ( see Early Middle Ages ) .
The administrative seat of each province is an episcopal see .
In hierarchical Christian churches that have dioceses , a province is a collection of those dioceses ( as a basic unit of administration ) .
Over the years certain provinces adopted the status of metropolis and have a certain degree of self - rule .
A bishop of such province is called the metropolitan bishop or metropolitan .
The Roman Catholic Church ( both Latin and Eastern Catholic ) , the Orthodox Churches and the Anglican Communion all have provinces .
These provinces are led by a metropolitan archbishop .

DIGITAL Command Language ( DCL ) is the standard command language
adopted by most of the operating systems ( OSs ) that were sold by the former Digital Equipment Corporation ( which was acquired by Compaq , which was in turn acquired by Hewlett - Packard ) .
DCL had its roots in the IAS , TOPS-20 , and RT-11 OSs and was implemented as a standard across most of Digital 's OSs , notably RSX-11 , but took its most powerful form in the OpenVMS OS .
Written when the programming language Fortran was in heavy use , DCL is a scripting language supporting several datatypes , including strings , integers , bit arrays , arrays and booleans , but not floating point numbers .
Access to OpenVMS system services ( kernel API ) is through lexical functions , which perform the same as their compiled language counterparts and allow scripts to get information on system state .
DCL includes IF - THEN - ELSE , access to all the Record Management Services ( RMS ) file types including stream , indexed , and sequential , but unfortunately lacks a DO - WHILE or other looping construct , requiring users to make do with IF and GOTO - label statements instead .
DCL is available for other operating systems as well , including VCL and VX / DCL for Unix , VCL for Unix , MS - DOS , OS/2 and Windows , and PC - DCL and Accelr8 DCL Lite for Windows .
DCL is the basis of the XLNT language , implemented on Windows by an interpreter - IDE - WSH engine combination with CGI capabilities distributed by Advanced System Concepts Inc. from 1997 .

Laibach ( ) is a Slovenian avant - garde music group associated with the industrial , martial , and neo - classical genres .
Formed in a small mining town of Trbovlje ( at the time in Yugoslavia ) in 1980 , Laibach represents the musical wing of the Neue Slowenische Kunst ( NSK ) collective , a group which Laibach helped found in 1984 .
" Laibach " is the German historical name for the Slovenian capital Ljubljana , itself an oblique reference to the Nazi occupation of Slovenia in World War II .

They also recorded several cover versions of popular songs , often turning light melodies into sinister - sounding Gothic tunes .
The band has seen numerous lineup changes , with Dejan Knez , Milan Fras , Ervin Markošek and Ivan Novak being the longest - standing members .
They have worked with a number of collaborators and guest musicians .

The economic history of the Republic of Ireland effectively began in 1922 , when the then Irish Free State won independence from the United Kingdom .
The state was plagued by poverty and emigration until the 1960s when an upturn led to the reversal of long term population decline .
However , global and domestic factors combined in the 70s and 80s to return the country to poor economic performance and emigration .
The 1990s , however saw the beginning of unprecedented economic success , in a phenomenon known as the " Celtic Tiger " , which continued until the 2008 global financial crisis , specifically the post-2008 Irish economic downturn .
It also led to the Republic of Ireland becoming the most indebted state in the European Union .
As of 2015 , the Republic has returned to growth , and was the fastest growing economy for that year .
Since August 2017 , Irish unemployment has been at a 9 year low of 6.1 % .
According to Oxford economic historian Kevin O'Rourke , Irish independence coupled with membership of the European Union have been crucial to Irish economic prosperity .

Cane is a 1923 novel by noted Harlem Renaissance author Jean Toomer .
The novel is structured as a series of vignettes revolving around the origins and experiences of African Americans in the United States .
The vignettes alternate in structure between narrative prose , poetry , and play - like passages of dialogue .
As a result , the novel has been classified as a composite novel or as a short story cycle .
Though some characters and situations recur between vignettes , the vignettes are mostly freestanding , tied to the other vignettes thematically and contextually more than through specific plot details .
The ambitious , nontraditional structure of the novel - and its later influence on future generations of writers - have helped Cane gain status as a classic of High Modernism .
Several of the vignettes have been excerpted or anthologized in literary collections , perhaps most famously the poetic passage " Harvest Song " , included in several Norton poetry anthologies .
The poem opens with the line : " I am a reaper whose muscles set at sundown . "
In 2000 Arion Press published an edition of Cane with woodblock prints by the artist Martin Puryear and an afterword by Leon Litwack .
The Washougal River is a tributary of the Columbia River in the U.S. state of Washington .
Its headwaters and upper are in Skamania County in the Gifford Pinchot National Forest , and its lower are in Clark County .
The river , which meets the Columbia near the cities of Washougal and Camas , is a popular stream for fishing , swimming , and boating .
Explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark referred to the Washougal River as the " Seal River . "
The name Washougal comes from the Cascades Chinook placename [ wasiixwal ] or [ wasuxal ] , meaning " rushing water " .
It has been suggested that D. B. Cooper , who hijacked a Boeing 727 in 1971 then parachuted from the plane with ransom money , may have landed in the Washougal River basin .
Kingsgate Castle on the cliffs above Kingsgate Bay , Broadstairs , Kent , was built for Lord Holland ( Henry Fox , 1st Baron Holland ) in the 1760s as the stable block of his nearby country residence Holland House ( his former London residence was renamed with the same name ) .
The name Kingsgate is related to an incidental landing of Charles II on 30 June 1683 ( ‘ gate’ referring to a cliff - gap ) though other English monarchs have also used this cove , such as George II in 1748 .
The building was later the residence of John Lubbock , 1st Baron Avebury .
Architects obtained complex planning consent in the 1990s for conversion of the castle into 31 flats , aesthetic enhancements and functional changes , built soon afterwards .

Microsoft QuickC was a commercial integrated development environment ( IDE ) product engineered by Microsoft for the C programming language , superseded by Visual C++ Standard Edition .
Its main competitor was Borland Turbo C.
QuickC was one of three Microsoft programming languages with IDEs of this type marketed in the same period , the other two being QuickBasic and QuickPascal .
QuickBasic later gave rise to Visual Basic as well as being included without a linker as QBasic in later versions of MS - DOS , replacing GW Basic .
QuickC is a lineal ancestor of Visual C++ .
The three Quick language implementations were designed for power users ( as opposed to professional developers , whom Microsoft supplied with programming languages in the form of expensive and more comprehensive implementations for the three languages in question as well as C++ , Fortran , and Cobol ) and educational use ; in all three cases their major competitor was Borland with its Turbo compiler series .
Microsoft Macro Assembler also competes with Borland 's Turbo Assembler
The unity of the intellect is a philosophical theory proposed by the Muslim medieval Andalusian philosopher Averroes ( 1126 – 1198 ) , which asserted that all humans share the same intellect .
Averroes expounded his theory in his long commentary of On the Soul to explain how universal knowledge is possible within the Aristotelian theory of mind .
Averroes ' theory was influenced by related ideas by previous thinkers such as Aristotle , Plotinus , Al - Farabi , Avicenna ( Ibn Sina ) and Avempace ( Ibn Bajja ) .
When Averroes ' works were translated into Latin , this theory was taken up and expanded by Averroists in Western Europe in the following centuries , such as Siger of Brabant , John of Jandun and John Baconthorpe .
It also influenced the secularist political philosophy of Dante Alighieri in the fourteenth century .
However , it was rejected by other philosophers — including Thomas Aquinas , who wrote a detailed critique — and received condemnation by Catholic Church authorities .
In modern times , it is no longer seen as a tenable theory and is considered a product of Averroes ' time .
A shared church , or Simultankirche , simultaneum or , more fully , simultaneum mixtum , a term first coined in 16th - century Germany , is a church in which public worship is conducted by adherents of two or more religious groups .
Such churches became common in the German - speaking lands of Europe in the wake of the Protestant Reformation .
The different Christian denominations ( such as Roman Catholic , Lutheran , Reformed , or United , etc .
) , share the same church building , although they worship at different times and with different clergy .
It is thus a form of religious toleration .
Simultaneum as a policy was particularly attractive to rulers who ruled over populations which contained considerable numbers of both Catholics and Protestants .
It was often the opposite of cuius regio , eius religio and used in situations where a ruler was of a different religion than the majority of the people , and not strong enough to impose his religion on the population .
During the Nine Years ' War ( 1688 – 1697 ) , Louis XIV of France occupied the Electorate of the Palatinate , a Protestant region situated mainly in the western part of what is today Germany , where he introduced the simultaneum .
At the end of the war the region returned to Protestant control , but a last - minute addition to the Treaty of Ryswick provided for a continuation of the simultaneum .
Although intended to apply only to the Palatinate , the simultaneum was subsequently also applied in portions of Protestant Alsace ( a region ruled by France , but where the Edict of Fontainebleau was not enforced ) .

According to her contemporary George Templeton Strong , Miller was active in New York City prostitution from the late 1810s .
By 1821 , she was running a brothel on Church Street , where she had accumulated personal effects worth at least $ 500 .
Over Miller 's 30-year career , she became quite wealthy .
At one point or another , Miller ran houses on Duane , Elm , Orange and Reade streets .
She owned , but did not manage , another brothel on Cross Street .
Rumors suggested that , in the 1840s , she charged her girls $ 14 a week to stay in her brothels .
By 1855 , she had many personal residences ; the one on Church Street alone contained effects valued at $ 5,000 .
Miller was a celebrity as well .

ABBA Live is an album of live recordings by Swedish pop group ABBA , released by Polar Music in 1986 .
A live album was something that many ABBA fans had demanded for several years .
ABBA themselves had toyed with the idea on a couple of occasions , but always decided against it .
Finally , four years after the members went their separate ways , a live collection was released after all .
The resultant album , ABBA Live , contained recordings from 1977 , 1979 and 1981 .
The tracks were mostly taken from ABBA ’s concerts at Wembley Arena in London in November 1979 , with a few additional songs taken from the tour of Australia in March 1977 and the Dick Cavett Meets ABBA television special , taped in April 1981 .
When this LP / CD was released , the band 's popularity was at an all - time low and none of the members themselves were involved in the production of the album .
Much to the dismay of both music critics and ABBA fans it also had 80 's synth drums overdubbed on most tracks , taking away the true live feeling of the performances .
Neither did it feature any of the tracks that the band had performed live on their tours but never included on any of their studio albums , such as " I Am an A " , " Get on the Carousel " , " I 'm Still Alive " , or the original live versions of the songs from the 1977 mini - musical The Girl with the Golden Hair : " Thank You for the Music " , " I Wonder ( Departure ) " and " I 'm a Marionette " , all of which had slightly different lyrics and/or musical arrangements to the subsequent studio recordings included on .
Several tracks had also been heavily edited , in the case of the 1979 live recording of " Does Your Mother Know " by as much as five minutes since it originally was performed on that tour as a medley with " Hole in Your Soul " .
ABBA Live was the first ABBA album to be simultaneously released on LP and CD , the CD having three " extra tracks " .
The album did not perform very well , internationally or domestically , peaking at # 49 in Sweden and only staying in the charts for two weeks .
It was remastered and rereleased by Polydor / Polar in 1997 , but is currently out of print .
